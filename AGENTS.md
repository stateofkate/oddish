# Oddish Repository Guide

This file is the technical guide for the entire monorepo. End-user CLI docs live in `DOCS.md`.
Manually invoked diagnostics and statistics rebuild commands are indexed in
`docs/operations-tools.md`; evaluate their operational use before pruning them.

The repo has three main packages:

- `oddish/` — the core Python CLI, FastAPI server, queueing layer, and worker runtime
- `backend/` — the hosted cloud layer built on top of `oddish`; adds multi-tenant auth, Modal deployment, and product-specific endpoints
- `frontend/` — the Next.js App Router dashboard and public pages

Python `3.13` is required for `oddish` and `backend`. Node.js `20+` and `pnpm` are required for `frontend`.

## Maintenance Notes

Process rules (the three PR stages, PR hygiene, the documents-to-update
table, and the compatibility rule) live in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. In short:

- Keep `DOCS.md` focused on end-user CLI workflows; keep `oddish/README.md` as a short package quick start.
- Put `oddish` implementation details, architecture notes, and local development guidance here.
- If you change the CLI surface in `oddish/src/oddish/cli/`, update `DOCS.md`,
  the command list in `oddish/README.md`, and the packaged agent skill under
  `oddish/src/oddish/assets/skills/oddish/` (served by `oddish skill`).
- If you change API contracts, queue behavior, or storage layout, update this file.
- If you change `backend/` auth, deployment, or worker orchestration, update this file.
- If you change `frontend/` routing, API proxy structure, or auth behavior, update this file.
- Preserve the package boundary: `oddish/` must remain self-hostable for the
  CLI and standalone server; hosted product concerns (auth, org membership,
  Modal app wiring, managed worker spawning, GitHub/webhook integrations, and
  cloud-only policy) belong in `backend/`.
- Before changing anything a client or another package reads, find its
  readers first; see "Installed clients are always behind the server" under
  Repo-wide Gotchas.

## Pruning files and operational knowledge

Before deleting a file, identify who or what uses it. Application modules,
manually invoked operator tools, migration/repair commands, tests, runbooks, and
historical campaign records have different evidence of use. No imports or text
references is evidence to investigate, not proof that a file is useless.

- Check runtime and indirect entry points: CLI registration, dynamic imports,
  framework file conventions, Modal functions, package exports, scheduled jobs,
  CI workflows, deployment commands, and operator documentation. Search callers
  of a public interface as well as the concrete implementation being removed.
- For standalone scripts, read their arguments, side effects, dependencies, and
  Git history. A `one-off` label or old filename does not establish that a
  database check, artifact investigation, or repair command has no repeat use.
  Do not run a script against production merely to determine whether to keep it.
- For runbooks and incident notes, identify information that would otherwise be
  lost: failure symptoms and causes, credential placement, export formats,
  recovery procedures, and experiment-validity rules. Name the surviving
  replacement and verify it contains that information before deleting the source.
  Documentation does not need a code caller to be useful.
- Separate reusable knowledge from stale instructions. Archive campaign-specific
  records with a clear historical label; remove or update fixed experiment IDs,
  local paths, obsolete bypass flags, model prices, and deployment assumptions
  before presenting a tool as current. Keep useful tools discoverable in
  `docs/operations-tools.md`. Git history is recovery, not a substitute for a
  discoverable operating guide.
- Remove a helper and its tests only after checking its remaining callers and
  the coverage that survives. Do not remove tests just to make a deletion pass.
  Check shared interfaces for methods still required by other implementations
  or callers. Run the relevant tests, imports, builds, and CLI checks; distinguish
  static checks from actual execution and identify unverified cloud behavior.
- Keep restoration separate from changes to operating policy. Preserve existing
  expert advice when recovering a runbook; raise concerns separately instead of
  silently rewriting evaluation rules, thresholds, or campaign instructions.
- Keep a pruning PR reviewable: describe each deletion category, the evidence
  that it is obsolete or replaced, where any retained knowledge moved, and the
  checks performed. Separate uncertain operational removals from clearly dead
  application code. If use remains unclear, retain the file and state the open
  question rather than silently classifying it as dead.

## CLI delivery selection

`oddish ls` forwards lab, category, QA, summary-threshold, date, and author
filters to `/tasks/browse`; it does not implement eligibility or query the DB.
`--count` and `--ids` use the existing count/ID-only modes; the latter preserves
`truncated` in JSON. `delivery create/add --tasks-file` validates that complete
JSON selection locally and submits at most 5,000 deduplicated IDs atomically.
The standalone browse route also exposes lab/category/summary filters, ID-only
responses, and `/tasks/browse/facets` using the shared core. Author resolution
remains hosted-only. CLI shipment history is rendered from browse `deliveries`,
with no extra request per task; `delivery history` retains its QA-trail meaning.

Task browse `selection_id` references a saved filter whose `filter_ast.task_ids`
contains an exact set (1–5,000 IDs). The SQL subquery expands authorized IDs once, enforcing the
organization and private-owner/ORG visibility rules in page, count and IDs modes;
no new table or per-row lookup is needed. The hosted save endpoint and CLI
`ls --share-selection` use the existing saved-filter writer. The standalone
browser can read ORG selections in its local organization scope.

Browse `deliveries` remains imported/finalized history for older clients;
`active_deliveries` is additive and carries active batch membership. Both load in
the existing union query. Records now include `delivery_id` and `status`. Task
rows stay visible in delivery picking; only select-all IDs excludes existing
members. Table columns, lab context and card/table presentation live in the URL
without changing browse request keys unless an actual filter changes.
Adding a task whose delivery membership has `deleted_at` set restores that row
and appends it in request order, retaining its notes. Live members remain no-ops.

Harbor task execution → logs/results/artifacts (S3)
```

High-level flow:

1. Upload a task bundle directly to S3 via a presigned PUT URL.
2. Submit a sweep of agent/model trials for that task; each trial is
   enqueued as a `worker_jobs` row in the same transaction as its domain
   row. Set `max_trial_attempts` on a sweep submission or sweep config to
   override the total attempt budget for newly-created trials. Re-submitting
   the same task-version/experiment sweep reconciles to the requested count:
   live non-failed trials are retained, while failed slots get fresh trial
   rows and the old attempts point to those replacements through
   `superseded_by_trial_id`. This preserves retry history without leaving the
   failed attempts in normal UI/API trial sets.
   External orchestrators that need strictly additive work set
   `add_trials=true`, provide the exact current `task_version_id`, and provide
   an `external_request_id`. That external identity has long-lived, replay-only
   semantics: retries return the original `new_trials` (including each version
   pin) and never reinterpret a failed leaf as new work.
   Hosted sweep identity is resolved once into `SweepAttribution` before the
   core call. New tasks and experiments receive their creator, API-key, owner,
   display-owner, and link provenance in their constructors; returning an
   existing experiment never claims or rewrites that provenance. Trial imports,
   collections, and combined experiments follow the same create-only owner rule.
3. Workers claim one `worker_jobs` row at a time, dispatch to the registered
   handler for its kind, write heartbeats, and exit.
   Harbor's `RetryConfig` owns exception include/exclude policy and backoff for
   both retry scopes. `Trial` first retries typed installer transport failures
   and transient provider `ApiError` failures in the active sandbox, up to
   `max_in_place_retries`; resumable agents continue their session, while other
   agents rerun the original instruction in the existing working tree. A final
   failure crosses the result boundary once through `ExceptionInfo`, including
   optional HTTP status, request ID, session ID, and retry-after metadata.
   Harbor's `TrialQueue` still owns whole-trial retries, and Oddish
   `worker_jobs` owns durable fresh-sandbox retries across worker processes.
   Harbor runs the verifier even when the agent phase raised. In
   `oddish.core.harbor_artifacts`, `invalidates_score`
   identifies recorded provider, authentication, and transport exceptions that
   invalidate the score, including failures after partial agent work. It does
   not classify all infrastructure failures. Every settlement path — the Harbor
   `END` hook, `_store_trial_results`, the CLI's `trial_result_to_import_spec`,
   and the legacy `worker/local_runner.py` — drops the reward rather than
   publishing it as a score. The trial follows the existing path for a missing
   verifier reward: the error surfaces and `RetryConfig` decides retry or
   fail. Endings the agent's own run caused — `AgentTimeoutError`,
   `AgentSafetyRefusalError`, and the context/output budget errors — keep their
   reward, because a real 0 must stay a real 0. Add a name to that set only when
   the provider, not the agent, ended the run.
   That rule needs the exception to reach settlement. Pinned Harbor omits
   `trial_results` from the job summary it writes, so a caller that rebuilds a
   `JobResult` from that file loses the per-trial exception and phase timing.
   The in-process runner passes the populated object `Job.run()` returns and is
   unaffected; the ephemeral parent reads the file, so
   `_extract_outcome_from_job_result` falls back to
   `_trial_results_from_job_dir`, which reads each trial's own `result.json`
   through Harbor's `JobScanner`. It reads every trial directory rather than the
   `oddish_trial_name` selector, because the recovered list stands in for
   `trial_results` and the caller applies its own first-error rule across the
   whole list. The reward itself always survived the omission: it resolves from
   the job-level `stats.evals` block, which that summary keeps.
   `oddish.workers.harbor.runner.uses_probe_routing` identifies shared routing rules for
   operator probes and `qa`, `qa_eval`, and `audit` analysis trials. It does not
   change their trial kinds or stored `is_probe` flags. `summarize` uses these
   rules only when explicitly configured with `harbor_config.mode = "probe"`.
4. Trajectory analysis is **task-scoped** and runs as a trial: when every
   agent trial of a task is terminal and `run_analysis` is enabled, one QA trial (`trials.kind = 'qa'`)
   is created on the same task. Its agent classifies
   every live trial, writes per-trial trajectory summaries, and synthesizes
   the task verdict into one artifact (`qa_result.json`); on settlement an
   importer writes `trials.analysis`, `trials.trajectory_summary`, and
   `tasks.verdict`. Once at least one eligible current-version solver trial
   exists, QA requests a verdict using every eligible trial, regardless of agent
   diversity. Existing eligibility exclusions and audit-readiness checks apply.
   A validated current audit with `must_fix` findings or a failed deterministic
   baseline rejects the task even with zero eligible solver trials. With zero
   eligible trials and no established rejection, the task completes with no
   verdict, `verdict_status=FAILED`, and an explicit insufficient-evidence error.
   With `run_analysis=False`, automatic settlement completes the task without
   writing a verdict or review error; explicit QA requests still run.
   Delivery requirements remain independently configurable (defaults: five
   trials and three agents); a verdict alone does not qualify a task for delivery. A sweep of `T` tasks × `N` trials therefore creates `T`
   QA trials, not `T × (N + 1)`. The pre-trial audit is an `audit`-kind trial
   created once per task version at sweep time. Its analysis payload pins the
   task content hash and the SHA-256 hash of the bundled pre-trial policy. A
   successful import copies the policy hash into `task_versions.pre_trial`, so
   operators can select versions that need a newer policy rerun. Historical
   audit trials and stored results can omit the hash.
   QA rerun and pre-trial audit endpoints accept an optional `environment`
   (`modal` or `daytona`); omitted/null retains the worker default. The task
   panel and bulk Run QA toolbar use the worker default. Explicit API selections are
   stored on the new trial and survive retries; they do not change the global
   default or the environment of automatically enqueued follow-up QA.
   Replacement QA requests preflight every eligible source through the same
   result, verifier, and trajectory readers exposed to the analysis sandbox.
   Missing started-trial result/verifier evidence or a `has_trajectory = true`
   row without a readable trajectory returns HTTP 409 before stored analysis is
   reset or the current verdict is withdrawn.
   `POST /qa-evals` is the lower-level historical prompt-replay primitive. It
   creates one output experiment and one `qa_eval` trial per exact source
   solver trial. Terminal failed sources remain replayable when no trajectory
   was recorded; the QA brief then uses the result, verifier, exception, and
   authoritative trial facts without inventing agent actions. Each new trial
   stores its source-trial id and prompt hash,
   plus a creation-time snapshot of the source trial's status, reward,
   trajectory availability, and agent. The in-sandbox verifier and settlement
   importer use that snapshot to reject a QA artifact that changes those
   server-owned facts.
   Short-lived read keys bound to an analysis trial store the full trial ID;
   `api_keys.bound_analysis_trial_id` therefore shares the 160-character limit
   of `trials.id`.
   It reuses the normal QA brief and `qa_result.json`, and writes the candidate
   analysis only to the new trial. Hosted creation resolves the authenticated
   caller as the payer, admits the validated replay count once, and stamps that
   payer on every new `qa_eval` trial. When
   `ODDISH_QUOTA_COUNTS_ANALYSIS_AND_COMPUTE` is on,
   queued analysis trials reserve quota through the same inflight predicates as
   solver trials; automatic QA, audit, and summarize trials remain org-level
   spend with a null payer. Callers retain the returned trial ids and read
   results through the existing single-trial endpoint.
   Non-'agent' kinds are excluded from solver cost, leaderboard, facet, and
   public surfaces (see `oddish.filters.trial_predicates.EligibleTrialScope`);
   their separate cost and optional quota basis comes from `analysis_spend`.
   Its `audit_context` request field defaults to `current`, which injects the
   task version's current source-audit findings and matches normal web-app QA.
   Historical golden-label comparisons pass `audit_context="none"`; that mode
   omits current audit findings so a newly discovered `must_fix` issue cannot
   make an older `GOOD_FAILURE` expectation impossible.
5. While a trial runs, a worker-side tailer (`oddish.workers.harbor.live_tail`,
   on by default via `live_tail_enabled` / `live_tail_interval_sec`) polls the
   agent's log file inside the sandbox for supported agents (claude-code,
   codex, cursor-cli, grok-build, tbh, mini-swe-agent), folds token usage, checkpoints live
   tokens/cost onto the trial row (`UPDATE … WHERE finished_at IS NULL`, so
   inflight quota reservations only tighten), and appends transcript events to
   `trial_events` (PK `(trial_id, attempt, seq)`, capped at 5000 events).
   `GET /trials/{id}/live` serves them with an `(attempt, after_seq)` cursor to
   `oddish logs [--follow]` and the dashboard Live tab. Events are purged when
   the trial goes terminal (S3 stays the permanent record); a 24h TTL sweep in
   the cleanup pass reaps rows leaked by hard-killed workers. A RETRYING trial
   clears `finished_at` and keeps its cost monotonic so it still counts as
   inflight for quotas and `/live`. Claude assistant deltas and tool blocks carry
   a hashed `turn_id` in their event payload so clients can distinguish streamed
   suffixes from a new no-tool assistant turn without exposing provider message
   identifiers. Claude message payloads also carry a `block_index` and
   `text_mode` (`append` or `replace`) so clients can assemble corrected text
   snapshots without concatenating stale content.
   Each persisted cost checkpoint re-evaluates enforced quotas. Reaching a
   payer's rolling-24h cap cancels every quota-counted nonterminal trial billed
   to that payer; reaching the org's monthly cap cancels every quota-counted
   nonterminal trial in the org. Final result settlement performs the same
   check for agents without live usage. Cancellation retires queued, running,
   blocked, and retrying worker jobs in the database before terminating remote
   handles; a task is failed only when no other live trial remains. Queuing
   replacement QA withdraws the previous verdict through `queue_verdict`.
   Completion publishes only the new verdict; a classification-only pass
   completes with SUCCESS status and no verdict unless current audit or
   baseline evidence establishes a deterministic rejection. Cancellation, failure, or
   abandonment of an active replacement never restores its previous result.
   Cancelling unrelated trials preserves an existing verdict when no QA
   replacement was active. Older QA artifacts remain in trial storage.
   All task verdict-column mutations go through `oddish.core.verdict_state`. The
   `ck_tasks_published_verdict_status` database constraint rejects a published
   payload with a missing or FAILED status.
6. Trial completion persists queryable execution metrics on the trial row:
   input/cache/output tokens, total trajectory steps, native runtime cost when
   reported, phase timing, readable trajectory availability, arbitrary verifier
   `metrics.json`, and a compact `_verifier` summary when the verifier emits a
   Common Test Report Format `verifier/ctrf.json`. The full CTRF report stays in
   S3; only counts, the tool name, and the report's trial-relative artifact path
   are stored in `trials.result`. Use the CLI or dashboard to watch progress and
   pull logs/artifacts back locally.
   Before upload, restricted-runtime transport values are removed from valid
   `.json` artifacts by parsing and recursively redacting strings, which keeps
   numbers and booleans typed and the JSON parseable. Logs, malformed JSON, and
   binary artifacts use the streaming byte scrubber.
   It also derives trajectory elapsed time and tool usage directly from ATIF
   steps into `trials.trajectory_duration_seconds`, `trials.total_tool_calls`,
   and `trials.tool_counts`. Task and experiment filters combine model and
   trajectory metric constraints against the same eligible trial. Their
   `any` mode requires one passing trial; `all` requires at least one eligible
   trial and rejects the row when any eligible trial fails the constraints.
   The canonical cross-surface contract is `oddish.filters.TrialMetricFilter`;
   CLI and API adapters must parse/serialize through it. SQL surfaces must use
   `oddish.filters.trial_predicates.build_trial_metric_predicate` with an
   injected `EligibleTrialScope` rather than reimplementing Any/All logic.

Agent capability analysis (the successful-vs-failing cohort comparison) has
been removed: its endpoints, cohort blocks, and UI pane are gone, and nothing
enqueues or handles `ANALYZER` jobs any more (the enum value survives only so
historical rows stay readable). The output schema (`AgentCapabilitiesOutput`
and its sub-models) was removed from `oddish.analyze.models` once nothing
referenced it; recover it from git history if the feature returns as a
`'capabilities'` analysis trial. Only the prompt,
`oddish/src/oddish/analyze/prompts/agent_capabilities.txt`, is still kept.
Shared trial drawers paint terminal trials from the slim row already owned by
the task or experiment page while the authoritative `GET /trials/{id}` resource
loads. Trial controls prefetch that resource on pointer or keyboard intent, and
the drawer owns its SWR cache entry and passes the authoritative trial to the QA
card, so one trial must never produce parallel detail requests. Drawers open on
Summary and fetch trajectory and summary resources independently only after
explicit user or URL intent. Collapsed trajectory steps must not mount their
message,
reasoning, tool, or observation bodies; those potentially large bodies mount
only while the step is expanded. Trajectory summaries are written onto
`trials.trajectory_summary` by the task's QA trial import or by a
`summarize`-kind trial's import; the read path never generates. The public
summary route stays a plain column read. The authenticated routes split reads
from paid mutation: `GET /trials/{id}/trajectory/summary` returns the resource,
while
`POST /trials/{id}/trajectory/summary` (TASKS scope, member-created keys
refused, matching an analysis rerun) creates or adopts the current summarize
trial. Both authenticated methods return `{summary, refresh}` so the published
summary and its replacement lifecycle cannot hide each other. They answer 200
whenever `summary` is present, including while `refresh` is active or failed;
without a published summary, an active refresh answers 202 and a failed refresh
answers 409. `refresh` carries `status`, `job_id`, and either
`retry_after_ms` or failure `detail`; 404 means neither publication nor refresh
exists. The frontend's one summary hook owns POST, the cache transition, and
SWR polling.

A QA/audit/summarize trial's **own** summary is deterministic, never an LLM call:
settlement (`handle_analysis_trial_settled`) counts one from the run's tool
calls. `oddish.analyze.trajectory_tool_calls` owns the external ATIF tool-call
name and string-argument spellings used by activity, provenance, and delegation
scans. `oddish.analyze.analysis_activity` applies analysis-shaped labels such as
`fetching_trial_data` / `writing_result`, one component per contiguous
same-label run and stores it through the same enrichment as graded-trial
summaries. These payloads carry `generator: "analysis-activity"` and the
explicit `taxonomy_version = "analysis-activity:v1"`; any semantic change to
the ordered activity rules must increment that version. Summary prose names
only actions present in the trajectory, so a failed partial run does not claim
an unobserved oddish-query fetch or `/logs` artifact write. The same settlement
scans the QA trajectory's tool-call
arguments for each graded trial id and stamps the matching step ids onto the
graded trial's `analysis._graded_at_steps`, which the drawer's "graded by"
link uses as a `#step-` anchor into the QA run. Both writes are best-effort
telemetry: neither may block or fail the artifact import. The Activity card
degrades rather than hides when a trial has steps but no stored summary — a
single gray ungrouped band with real totals — once the summary fetch settles.

The `summarize` trial kind is the LLM path for one trial's summary. At worker
pickup, `materialize_summarize_brief` reads the target's trajectory,
instruction, and verifier output directly through `oddish.core.trial_io`, then
removes empty steps, images, oversized text, embedded subagent trajectories,
and as much of the middle as needed to keep the serialized trajectory below
400,000 characters. The worker stages that bounded prompt instead of giving
the sandbox an oddish-query CLI, Oddish API credential, or internet access.
Harbor loads `SingleLLMAgent` through `AgentConfig.import_path`; the agent uses
Harbor's `LiteLLM` once, writes `summary_result.json`
(`{target_trial_id, trajectory_summary}`), and emits an ATIF trajectory with
one LLM step plus one deterministic artifact-write step. Harbor's normal trial
result therefore remains the source for status, timing, tokens, cost, logs,
verification, retries, and S3 artifacts. The result is validated in-sandbox
and at import by the shared checker, and its importer overwrites only the
target's `trials.trajectory_summary` — no verdict, task, or analysis state.
Only `kind = 'agent'` trials with `has_trajectory` can be summarize targets;
QA and audit remain tool-using claude-code trials, while QA, audit, and
summarize runs keep their deterministic own summaries. The target's nullable
`trials.trajectory_summary_refresh_trial_id` is the durable identity of the
summarize trial responsible for its next published summary; `harbor_config`'s
`target_trial_id` remains an artifact-validation boundary, not job discovery.
Creation locks Task then target Trial, sets the pointer in the same transaction
as the summarize Trial and WorkerJob, and adopts a live or successfully settled
pointed trial. `reserve_next_trial_index` takes the Task lock itself, so two
different targets on one task cannot allocate the same `{task_id}-{N}` id.
Import locks the target and writes only when its pointer still equals the
summarize trial id; it writes `trajectory_summary` and clears the pointer in one
transaction, so a delayed older importer cannot replace a newer result. The
cleanup sweep selects at most 200 non-null pointers whose summarize trial is
SUCCESS and retries those imports after the cleanup transaction commits. A
worker that dies between trial settlement and import therefore leaves durable,
bounded recovery work instead of a permanently stale summary. In an S3-backed
run, a QA/audit/summarize trial cannot settle SUCCESS until its Harbor artifact
directory uploads successfully and the freshly uploaded attempt's root
`result.json` selects an existing child containing the required analysis result.
Pinned Harbor 0.20 omits its former `trial_results` array from that root job
summary, so the Oddish runner writes `oddish_trial_name` there after `Job.run()`
returns and before upload. That field contains the sole in-memory Harbor
`TrialResult.trial_name`; older stored roots with exactly one `trial_results`
entry remain readable. Pre-attempt shared prefixes whose Harbor 0.20 root
summary has neither selector retain the historical recursive readers; only new
`attempt-N` prefixes require the explicit selector. CLI and ZIP import archive
construction writes the same selector into a copied root manifest, leaving the
external Harbor job unchanged;
import completion resolves the uploaded layout and rejects an unreadable archive
before advancing task state. Zero- or multi-result jobs receive no selection and
fail settlement instead of choosing a directory by listing siblings.
If the outcome reports a trajectory, that same selected child must also contain
`agent/trajectory.json`. An upload or layout-validation failure uses the trial's
normal retry budget. Storage list/download errors during import propagate so
cleanup retries them. A successfully settled summarize trial whose stored
artifact is absent or
violates the pinned contract becomes FAILED while the target pointer remains,
so GET reports 409 and the next POST replaces it instead of adopting a SUCCESS
trial that can never publish.

`trials.kind` is the canonical analysis-run discriminator. Worker preparation,
analysis overlays, artifact filenames, query access, upload prefixes, summarize
materialization, and Harbor's task-validation exception derive from that column.
`harbor_config.mode` is reserved for the existing operator-probe value `probe`;
analysis trials must not duplicate `qa`, `qa_eval`, `audit`, or `summarize` there.
QA-eval source identity lives only in
`harbor_config.analysis_payload.trial_ids`, which contains exactly one id for a
QA-eval run. The shared `oddish.core.analysis_payload` parser enforces that
cardinality for both bound-key authorization and artifact import; malformed
QA-eval payloads authorize no source trial and fail import with the same error.

Trajectory summaries use schema v6. Each taxonomy-valued `components` entry
contains its `step_ids`, summary, and deterministic `tool_count` and
`duration_ms` metadata. Step count is the length of `step_ids`; the other
analytics are computed from the immutable
trajectory after LLM parsing (not generated by the model). Component duration is
the sum of each included step's elapsed time since the preceding trajectory
step; the first step and steps without two usable timestamps contribute zero.
The frontend derives the same values for older summaries that lack the fields.
Every summary consumer and warmup path must compare the stored
`schema_version` with the packaged schema version; truthiness of
`trials.trajectory_summary` is not a freshness check.

QA analyzer prompts are **not** stored in the database. They ship as packaged
files under `oddish/src/oddish/analyze/`: `prompts/pre_trial_qa.txt` drives the
source audit, `classify_prompt.txt` drives the per-trial log classifier,
`verdict_prompt.txt` drives verdict synthesis, and
`prompts/trajectory_summary.txt` drives schema-v6 trajectory summaries; the
summary template must retain the `{{taxonomy}}` placeholder, rendered by the
QA-trial brief builder (`oddish.workers.analysis_trials`). Editing a prompt is
a code change that ships with a deploy.

Both source-audit and solver-classification prompts allow the author-provided
reference baseline to install a bundled executable without rebuilding source.
Solver source/language/build requirements still apply to normal solver grading;
reference leaks, stored-answer replay, reward tampering, and broken baselines
remain defects. After changing this policy, use the source-audit rerun endpoint
for affected current versions: deploying a prompt does not replace stored
findings or their task verdicts. The stored `audit_policy_hash` identifies which
audit policy produced each result.

`POST /tasks/{task_id}/qa/pre-trial` accepts an optional JSON body with
`environment: "modal" | "daytona"`; `POST /qa-evals` accepts the same field.
The provider is stored on each created analysis trial as `trials.environment`,
so workers and retries execute on that provider. An omitted or null value
retains the deployed worker default. Source solver trials are unchanged.

Each automatic QA brief snapshots authoritative Trial facts (id, status,
reward, trajectory availability, and agent), current-version nop/oracle
baseline results, and the source-audit status/findings into its pinned analysis
payload. The QA agent fetches complete result, verifier, and trajectory
resources for each solver Trial; it writes judgments only. Import restores
`trial_name` and `reward` from the graded Trial row, and a source-audit
`must_fix` finding or failed deterministic baseline rejects an otherwise
accepted or absent model verdict. Trial classifications, rewards, and summaries
retain their own meaning: a `GOOD_FAILURE` can coexist with task rejection.

New QA jobs pin a fingerprint of source bytes, audit status, timestamps, and
findings (excluding later exploitation annotations). Import checks it and the
latest uncancelled QA identity under the task lock before storing classifications
and again before publishing the verdict. Legacy jobs without a fingerprint
must match the current audit finding IDs and must-fix subset. An audit rerun
withdraws the old verdict and returns the task to RUNNING; admission waits for
all solver and existing QA jobs, plus audit execution and result publication,
then creates one replacement QA. `task_audit_pending` checks both live audit jobs
and the current version's PENDING/QUEUED/RUNNING audit status; automatic admission,
manual QA, and cleanup share this gate. A terminal audit job alone cannot
complete the task. Both
audit and QA settlement re-enter admission. Cleanup requeues QA whose saved
audit no longer matches instead of repeatedly importing it. Audit writes also
check the latest audit trial under the version lock, and duplicate successful
imports preserve the original timestamps and exploitation annotations.

General task-run cancellation mirrors a cancelled audit onto its task version
in the same transaction, setting pending pre-trial status to FAILED with the
audit's error and finish time. `settle_cancelled_audit_status` requires the
owning task lock and verifies that the latest non-superseded audit is cancelled
and no audit execution remains active. Cleanup runs this repair before QA
admission for historical stranded versions, reporting `cancelled_audits_healed`.
It defers versions whose task still has active trials or worker jobs and closes
an idle current-version task without launching replacement QA, while
preserving published verdicts, newer audits, and work in other experiments.

Delivery boards expose the latest QA run's evidence coverage and completion time.
`oddish.core.delivery_qa` compares its pinned solver/baseline evidence and source
audit with the current default version, using the same eligibility clauses and
evidence serialization as QA admission. A recent timestamp alone does not make
a result current. The board's seven-day/24-hour counter includes current accepted
and rejected results, excluding execution failures and in-flight runs; it does
not change the existing delivery sign-off requirements.
Classification-only QA can still publish a deterministic baseline rejection;
that verdict counts when its `_graded_by` identifies the selected QA run.
Legacy synthesized verdicts without `_graded_by` remain readable.

`task_versions.qa_work` stores owner user ID, claim time, issue categories (first
is primary), and handoff note once per version across deliveries. TASKS-scoped
authenticated users may POST `/deliveries/{id}/qa-work/claim`; version locks and
SKIP LOCKED prevent duplicate claims across deliveries. PATCH
`/deliveries/{id}/qa-work` requires ownership or an admin and supports release.
Both require an active delivery and current version membership. Claims carry
candidate version IDs from the displayed filters, so stale browsers cannot
silently claim a newer version. New versions start unassigned. Finalized boards
retain their QA state and time cutoff in the existing snapshot. Hosted user-name
resolution stays in the delivery router; standalone coordination uses `local`.
The board preserves task rows and expanded history across selected-version
changes. QA-work drafts retain the version and notes from when they opened;
a changed version disables saving and keeps the notes available to copy.
Task-scoped `PUT /deliveries/{id}/checks` requests may include
`expected_version_id` (including explicit null). The core locks the task and
returns HTTP 409 if its selected default differs before writing or deleting a
sign-off, acknowledgment, waiver, or manual check. Positive sign-off and exception decisions require a non-null expected version
and an authenticated person. Other checks retain optional version matching for
older clients; the delivery board always supplies the displayed version.

`oddish assign` calls `POST /tasks/qa-work/assign` with up to 1,000 task IDs,
an assignee, and optional `replace`. Hosted assignment requires admin access
(a full-scope API key) and resolves email, user ID, or GitHub handle inside the
caller's organization. `oddish.core.qa_work` locks tasks then their current
versions in stable order, checks the whole batch before writing, and updates
the same `task_versions.qa_work` metadata used by delivery claims. Other owners
are skipped unless replacement is explicit; repeat assignments preserve claim
times, and notes/categories are retained. No delivery membership is required.
Active boards reflect the assignments; finalized snapshots remain unchanged.

QA and source audits submit a draft through `/probe-harness/submit-analysis-result`.
It runs the same strict validator used by the verifier and importer, allowing
one initial submission and two repairs. Missing fields remain validation errors.
Attempt JSON and validation messages are retained under
`/logs/<artifact>.submissions/` and copied into verifier artifacts. A later
invalid, missing, or over-limit submission removes any previously published
result, so a rejected draft cannot leave a stale accepted artifact.

### Worker job kinds

Tag projection workers must write the task browse projection before any
version projection, including VERSION-scope jobs. The task UPDATE holds the
task row lock through commit, matching sweep and QA's task-then-version order.
Writing the version first can deadlock an audit claim or QA start that already
holds the task lock. Keep the PostgreSQL concurrency regression in
`test_audit_claim_concurrency.py` passing without worker retries.

`WorkerJobKind` (in `oddish.db.models`):

- **Active**: `TRIAL` (Harbor trial execution — including `qa`, `qa_eval`,
  `audit`, and `summarize` kind trials), `TASK_EXPAND` (sweep expansion),
  `TAG_PROJECT` (tag recompute).
- **Legacy, enum-only**: `QA`, `VERDICT`, `ANALYSIS`, `QA_REVIEW`,
  `ANALYZER`, `ANALYZER_BLOCK`. QA/audit/analyzer work runs as trials now;
  no handler claims these kinds (workers claim only registered kinds), and
  `retirejobs01` cancelled any still-queued rows. The members stay so the
  native `worker_job_kind` Postgres type keeps the values historical rows
  reference. Nothing enqueues any of them anymore.

## Package Boundaries

`oddish` owns the execution core and shared queue/runtime primitives:

- core models and migrations, including `worker_jobs` and `queue_slots`
- unified claim/dispatch SQL, one `run_single_worker_job` runner, and a
  handler registry (`TrialJobHandler`, `TaskExpandJobHandler`,
  `TagProjectJobHandler`)
- analysis trials (`oddish.workers.analysis_trials`): brief builders,
  settlement importers, and the audit/QA pipeline edges. Workers execute no
  LLM calls of their own (the one exception is the probe transcript
  summarizer in `oddish/worker/probe_analysis.py`); every analysis agent
  runs as a trial on the analysis model's queue key
- the verdict state machine (`oddish.core.verdict_state`), the only writer
  for `tasks.verdict*` lifecycle columns, which withdraws the current result
  when replacement QA is queued and publishes only that pass's verdict
- shared queue-slot leasing, per-queue-key concurrency limits, and
  per-user fairness on `TRIAL` claims
- database-backed admin concurrency overrides; these take precedence over
  `ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES` and are read by both the dispatcher plan
  and each worker's slot acquisition. This is the supported way to change a
  per-model limit at runtime. The self-tuning advisory controller
  (`ODDISH_DYNAMIC_MODEL_CONCURRENCY` + `concurrency_controller.py`) is
  **deprecated** in favor of it: leave the flag OFF; enabling it logs a
  deprecation warning and the path may be removed
- stale-heartbeat reaping, RETRYING → QUEUED mirror-back, and pipeline
  stage reconciliation in one cleanup sweep
- soft-delete semantics on domain rows via the `deleted_at` column and
  a session-level filter (`oddish.db.soft_delete`)

The analyzer-block machinery (`oddish/src/oddish/blocks/`, the backend
`api/services/blocks/` tree, `summarize_trajectory`) is deleted; the
`analyzer_blocks` table is dropped, with each trial's newest stored summary
backfilled onto `trials.trajectory_summary` first. Trial-level trajectory
analysis and the task verdict are the QA trial's job (above); there is no
separate report machinery.

`oddish` must not import from `backend/`, `backend.auth`, `backend.models`,
`cloud_policy`, `idempotency_store`, Clerk, or Modal app/deployment modules.
Keep optional provider/runtime SDK imports lazy behind core abstractions so a
CLI/self-host install can run without hosted deployment dependencies. If shared
behavior is needed by both products, put the host-agnostic primitive under
`oddish/src/oddish/core`, `oddish/src/oddish/workers`, or another neutral
`oddish` module, then wrap it from `backend/`.

`backend` wraps `oddish` with the hosted-only layer: Clerk/API key auth,
org-scoped APIs, Modal worker spawning and runtime patching, cloud environment
policy, GitHub notification hooks, and public sharing / product endpoints.

`frontend` provides the user-facing layer: the authenticated dashboard,
Clerk-based auth and org management, and Next.js route handlers that proxy
requests to the backend.

The hosted `/admin` dashboard is tenant-scoped even though its core diagnostic
helpers also serve the global self-hosted/operator view. Ordinary hosted queue
status, queue health, worker, orphan, cost, per-user cost, and task-expansion
handlers must pass `auth.org_id`; never accept an organization selector from
the client. A user cost drilldown returns 404 when the requested user belongs
to another org. Deployment-wide diagnostics or mutations (global queue
status/health and slot topology, model concurrency, shared-channel Slack
alert settings and the global cost-exclusion
lists) additionally require the
active org to match
`ODDISH_OPERATOR_ORG_ID`, which fails closed when unset; the frontend discovers
admin capabilities through `GET /admin/operator-access`, then hides those
controls for other orgs.
`GET /admin/concurrency` reports the deploy, database override,
deprecated-controller advisory, and actual effective limit for one canonical
queue key; `PUT /admin/concurrency` sets or clears the database override.

Admin cost exclusions (`oddish/core/cost_exclusions.py`) name spend that was
never really paid for, along three axes: a **model** (`cost_excluded_models`,
stored and matched by provider-independent model family against `trials.model`,
global and retroactive) and an **experiment**
(`cost_excluded_experiments`, matched against `trials.experiment_id` so a
collection cannot launder gathered trials' cost), or a provider key
(`cost_excluded_llm_keys`, matched through the one-way `trials.llm_key_hash`
stamped before execution, including BYOK overlays). All three fold into
`first_party_spend_filter` and the quota inflight predicates, so excluded
spend leaves the cost dashboards and stops counting against caps together.
It is dropped from accounting but **not** hidden: experiment, task, and trial
surfaces still render the money and label it, via `excluded_cost_usd` on the
experiment rollup and `cost_exclusion_reason` on `TrialResponse`. Keep the SQL
predicates and the `CostExclusions` Python twin in step — a surface that
labels spend differently from the way accounting drops it is worse than one
that says nothing. Callers that do not pass an exclusions snapshot report
`cost_exclusion_reason=None`, which means "unresolved", not "real".

The authenticated org-scoped cost leaderboard is served by `GET /leaderboard` in
`backend/api/routers/dashboard.py`. It shares the admin cost dashboard's
settled first-party spend basis and must stay in sync with its per-user rows:
every spend bucket except Unattributed ranks, including GitHub-identity buckets
with no registered user (shown by their submitted `@handle`). A registered
person's display name falls back name → `@github_username` → email local part,
so an account with no GitHub link still appears; the full email address must
never be exposed. The response deliberately exposes only a person's spend rank,
display name, and cost. Every query is restricted to the active auth
organization. The frontend `/leaderboard` page and dashboard top-five strip
must not add org, email, model, experiment, trial, or internal-id fields to
that contract. Each row also carries its spend rank so the rare row with no
safe display label (e.g. a payer outside the auth org) drops without
renumbering everyone else.

Dashboard experiment free text resolves every parsed bare token against active
members in the authenticated organization before the experiment page query
runs. `backend/dashboard_attribution.py` may search `users.name` and
`users.github_username`, then passes only the token-to-stable-user-id mapping
into `oddish.core.dashboard`; the self-hostable core must not import the hosted
`UserModel`. Each token's owner and latest-runner alternatives belong in the
page predicate before ordering and pagination so AND, OR, exclusion, and quoted
phrase semantics stay intact. The mapping is part of the experiments cache key.
`GET /people/search` is the ordinary READ-scope typeahead endpoint: it is
active-user and organization scoped, and returns `id`, `email`,
`display_name` (the email label), and `github_username`. The Members picker
shows account emails and submits stable user IDs. Search matches email, name,
and GitHub handle; results rank exact IDs, exact emails, then email prefixes,
with case-insensitive email ordering and ID ties before applying the limit.
An empty search lists accounts alphabetically by email, including accounts
without a name or GitHub handle. Dashboard author enrichment selects identity
columns directly to avoid loading organization and API-key relationships;
its existing historical-account and ambiguous-alias behavior is preserved.

The admin `GET /admin/costs` response includes analysis spend time series both
by model (`series_qa_by_model`) and by analyzer job kind
(`series_by_analysis_type`). The Cost breakdown chart exposes the latter as the
`Analyzer` stack; analyzer spend does not belong on the people leaderboard.

QA agree/disagree submissions live in the append-only core `feedback` table
(`FeedbackModel`) and use the hosted backend's authenticated
`POST /experiments/{id}/feedback` route. Every row requires a `trial_id`, a
`target` (`qa_verdict` or `qa_action_item`), the verdict classification or
action-item id as `target_key`, and an `agree` or `disagree` vote. Creation
validates organization scope and experiment membership through the shared
`trial_in_experiment` predicate. The dashboard waits for persistence, reports
errors, and permits one successful submission per mounted control. There are
no public, read, update, triage, snapshot, or notification paths.

### Reward Kit agent-judge costs

Tasks can opt into a worker-supplied record for a separate verifier with
`metadata.oddish.verifier_trusted_trajectory = true`. This also requires
`verifier_judge_costs = true`, one task step, and a separate Linux verifier.
It uses Oddish's bundled Harbor runtime. Ephemeral Harbor variants fail before
the child engine starts; they cannot silently omit the trusted input transfer.
The worker selects a fixed core verifier class. It rejects custom verifier
imports, kwargs, and disabled verification for this option. No task file can
supply a host import path or input path through this option.

After Harbor restores artifacts, the worker copies only the current trial's
host `agent/trajectory.json` into `/logs/verifier/input-trajectory.json` and
writes its SHA-256 to `/logs/verifier/input-trajectory.json.sha256`. The input
must be a regular, non-linked ATIF file of at most 20,000,000 bytes. The separate
image retains its own `/tests`; the worker does not upload replacement tests.
The hash identifies the supplied bytes. It does not establish the truth of
the tool output or other claims within the record.

If the host record is missing, invalid, or cannot be transferred, verification
returns reward zero before a judge starts. The worker writes a fixed error in
`verifier/step-judge-error.txt` and a programmatic failure to that trial's
`verifier/reward-details.json`, which establishes zero judge spend for this
failure. After standard verification starts, missing usage stays incomplete;
the worker does not replace it with a zero-cost report.

A task that uses paid Reward Kit agent judges must set this before submission:

```toml
[metadata.oddish]
verifier_judge_costs = true
```

The worker saves a pending cost record before it starts the task. It then reads
`verifier/reward-details.json` from the exact Harbor trial in the result manifest.
Uploaded local artifacts stay in place until result and judge cost settlement
finish. This keeps the usage report available after the S3 upload succeeds.
The read is limited to 2 MiB, 128 agent/LLM components, and 16 models per component.
Reward Kit 0.2.1 agent judges report input, output, cache-read, cache-write, and
per-model token counts. Input includes cache tokens. Oddish uses its model price
list and labels this cost `estimated`; it is not a provider invoice.

Each component and actual model has a stable ledger ID derived from the saved
trial ID and attempt. The worker takes org, task, experiment, and payer identity
from the locked trial row at the start, never from the report. The pending record
also binds the worker and queue job. That worker can settle its own attempt's
cost after cancellation, replacement, or loss of current ownership. The existing
result guards still prevent it from changing the current trial result. Repeated
settlement does not charge twice. Retry attempts remain separate charges. These records use
`analysis_costs.job_kind = verifier_judge`; the solver's `trials.cost_usd` keeps
its old meaning. No database migration or credential change is needed.

The initial record has `cost_source = pending` and no price. Settlement closes
that record with a zero price only when all usage is accounted for. If usage is
missing, a model has no known price, or a component reports paid tool requests
whose price is not supported, its accounting stays incomplete. Known token
charges are still saved. A worker crash leaves the pending record unpriced.
A report with only programmatic criteria records zero judge spend; use that
only when a verifier stops before it starts any judge. Missing or broken reports
never prove zero spend. LLM judges are not supported: Reward Kit 0.2.1 omits their
usage. A backend exception that loses agent usage also remains incomplete.

`GET /experiments/{id}/cost-totals` adds `qa_cost_complete`,
`qa_unpriced_count`, and `qa_pending_count`, plus the three `owned_qa_*`
equivalents. Counts refer to ledger records, including the attempt record.
Pending experiment counts require an unfinished trial. A completed trial with
an unpriced pending record is an accounting fault, not ongoing work. The dollar
total is only the known part while any unpriced record remains. Clients that
control a budget must wait for pending usage and stop new paid work when settled
usage is incomplete. These fields describe recorded usage; they do not mean
that all trials or later QA have finished. Costs on QA shadow trials count in
the parent experiment. The compact trial result `_verifier_judges` records the
attempt, fixed error codes, report digest, and report path. Full reports stay in
artifact storage. Task-authored metrics cannot set this reserved field.

This is opt-in accounting for trusted verifier usage records. It does not grant
model credentials, change network rules, run judges, or prove that every task
has declared its paid tools. Configure and validate verifier-only model access
before enabling paid judges. Existing tasks and older clients keep working.

### Task Identity

`GET /tasks/{task_id}/open` is the bounded first-paint contract for the task
page. It resolves one org-scoped task plus the requested/default version before
running aggregate work. Top-level task status always uses the default version
from `tasks.current_version_id`; selected-version counters, direct version tags,
experiments, and exact agent/model summaries use the requested version. Its
experiment list is derived from that version's live, non-probe, non-superseded,
non-combine trial population, matching `/detail`. Pre-trial audit metadata stays
on `/detail` and is not serialized with the bounded version summary. The
response also carries compact QA verdict presentation/control fields and one
`active_qa_trial` lightweight ref for the task's live, non-superseded QA run.
That ref is task-scoped rather than selected-version-scoped. Every lightweight
trial ref carries `kind` and `has_trajectory`, so a drawer can choose its
initial tab while the authoritative trial-detail request loads; the
selected-version trial preview remains capped at 20 rows. The handler uses at
most three SQL statements, stays below the
50 KB response budget, and must not select trial `result`, `analysis`,
`error_message`, jobs, or ORM relationships. `GET /tasks/{task_id}/detail`
remains the compatibility bundle for CLI and explicit full-history operations;
do not point the task route back at it.

`GET /tasks/{task_id}/panel?version=N` supplies task-panel audit metadata,
selected-version content hash, verdict, and action availability in two SQL
statements. Omitted version selects the task's default; missing or deleted
explicit versions return 404. Hosted readers use the verified organization ID.
The file panel uses this resource instead of polling `/detail` and basic task
state independently. Files load independently, overview trial evidence loads
on tab intent, and full retry targets load only on click; experiment-scoped
retries retain their host trial set. Unknown audit metadata keeps reruns disabled.
The normal 30-second panel poll detects in-place file revisions; active QA/audits
poll every five seconds.

`tasks.name` is the human-readable lookup key within an org. Live task names
must stay unique and indexed (`idx_tasks_unique_org_name`) so an upload of the
same task name resolves to the existing task and creates a new `task_versions`
row instead of creating a different task. Renaming a task is allowed, but any
rename path must preserve the live `(org_id, name)` uniqueness invariant and
must not split the task's version history.

`TaskStatusResponse.current_version` / `current_version_id` always report the
task's selected default (`tasks.current_version_id`), including on experiment
pages. Experiment endpoints may scope their trials and aggregate counts to an
experiment-relevant historical version so old or gathered runs remain visible,
but that trial-selection pivot must not replace the reported task default. They
report the pivot separately as `trial_version` / `trial_version_id`, including
on lightweight task shells that omit trial rows.

`tasks.current_version_id` is the user-selectable default, not necessarily the
numerically latest version. In an experiment view, `trial_version_id` uses that
default when the experiment has a non-superseded, non-probe trial for it;
otherwise it falls back to the highest version represented by such trials. The
bounded `/open` and `/trial-page` endpoints apply the same rule so progressive
loading cannot change the files/counts pivot or mix one version's trials with
another's artifacts. `/open` returns exact totals plus at most 100 task shells
under 50 KB. Reads that cover a whole experiment (`/open` totals,
`/trial-page`, cost totals, effective versions) select from
`experiment_trial_scope` (`core/experiment_membership.py`): `TrialModel`
aliased onto a `UNION ALL` of the experiment's homed rows and its gathered
rows, each an index seek, with combine copies removed by an anti-join. Do not
filter the whole `trials` table with `trial_in_experiment` for such reads: its
`experiment_id = X OR id IN (gathered)` cannot use an index and its correlated
subplan inflates the plan cost enough to JIT-compile every request.
Authenticated task shells include the complete `github_meta`
mapping parsed from the task's stored tags. Anonymous `/open`, `/focus`, and
task-detail responses use separate public response models: they omit task and
experiment owner fields and allowlist only the `category`, `world`, and `domain`
taxonomy key families from `github_meta`, so public dataset grouping does not
need repository metadata or task-owner identity. The anonymous `/open` and
`/focus` SQL projections must not select `tasks.user`; hiding owner fields in
React is not an access-control boundary. `/trial-page` returns at most 250
projected trials and omits full analysis, errors, results, phase timing, Harbor
config, and ORM relationships.
Experiment pages use `/results` for initial and incremental loading. Task and
trial collections each use one SQL `DECLARE`/`FETCH` cursor, fetched in batches
of 500 rows, within a read-only repeatable-read transaction so totals and rows agree.
Both cursors close on completion, failure, or client disconnect. The transaction
is required for cursor lifetime and snapshot consistency; this endpoint does not
use the autocommit read session. SQL cursors avoid asyncpg's unnamed prepared
statement cursor failures with the pooler's required `statement_cache_size=0`;
do not switch this to `AsyncSession.stream` without a real-driver regression.
Batches bound application row buffering, not
the database query's own sort/aggregate memory or the total response size.
The page displays downloaded task/trial counts independently of trials that
finished running. Only a validated completion record marks the download complete;
refresh failures retain and label the last complete results. A failed
response retains any downloaded rows and exposes Retry, including when the request
fails before metadata arrives. The older paginated endpoints remain available to
other clients.

`overwrite_current_version` replaces the archive and metadata for
`tasks.current_version_id` without changing its ID or version number. Uploads
land at a unique staging key, copy to an immutable
`tasks/<id>/v<N>-revisions/<token>/` source, and become visible only when the
version row atomically switches `task_s3_key`. Expanded-file readers accept a
manifest only when its `archive_key` matches that selected source, so failed
cleanup cannot expose the prior expansion. The replacement clears derived-file
bookkeeping, retained `reported_findings`, and pre-trial audit state before
re-enqueuing expansion. Same-content upload retries preserve those findings.
Existing
trials pinned to that version resolve to the replacement content.

Sweep appends resolve their own version through `resolve_append_version_id`
(`oddish/core/endpoints/sweep.py`). A submission whose `content_hash` is `None`
uploaded no task directory, so it pins new trials -- and scopes its
failed-trial reconciliation -- to the target experiment's effective version
rather than `tasks.current_version_id`. This keeps a top-up on the version the
experiment grid already displays instead of pivoting the whole row onto a
default that an unrelated run advanced. Only an experiment the submission names
explicitly counts: an append that falls back to the task's implicit primary
experiment keeps the task default, so probes and task-page top-ups never run
against older content. Submissions that carry content or name an experiment
with no trials for the task also keep the task default. `create_task` is
unaffected: a fresh task always runs its own upload.

The resolved version is threaded on to `maybe_enqueue_auto_probe` through
`_finalize_sweep`, so an auto-probe inspects the same content its sweep's
trials ran. A probe left on `tasks.current_version_id` while the trials sit on
an older pin would inspect content no trial used, be filtered out of the
experiment grid, and mark the wrong version probed -- leaving the version that
actually ran unprobed. Callers that pin nothing keep the task's current
version. The pre-trial audit trial enqueued inside `append_trials_to_task`
follows the same pin for the same reason.

`use_default_version` on `TaskSweepSubmission` (`--use-default-version`, or
`use_default_version: true` in a sweep config) is the opt-out for deliberately
moving an experiment onto the task's current content. It resolves per task, so
one flag covers a sweep whose tasks sit on different versions. It pins to the
task default rather than the numerically highest version, so the appended
trials are the ones the grid pivots to and stay visible.

Sherpa-native orchestration is the explicit-version exception to ordinary
append resolution. It supplies the selected `task_version_id`, `add_trials=true`,
and a durable `external_request_id`. Under the task row lock, Oddish rejects a
stale version with 409 rather than falling back to another version. Sherpa polls
hosted `POST /trials/status/query` and cancels through hosted
`POST /trials/cancel/batch`; both are bounded, org-scoped, exact-ID operations.
Exact-ID cancellation must settle cancelled audit state and resolve any
baseline gate before task QA admission, so no version or BLOCKED solver is
stranded.
Oddish owns admission and execution, while Sherpa owns Temporal orchestration,
projection, and any reward-hack analyzer fan-out. Do not add Temporal or Sherpa
analyzer dependencies to Oddish for this integration.

`GET /experiments/{experiment_id}/cost-totals` reports both cost and token
usage across every trial owned by the experiment, including older versions,
superseded retries, probes, and soft-deleted trials. Its `billed_*` cost and
token fields are the billed-user subset used by the frontend's New spend tile.

### Task-file publication and read latency

Task-file publication writes complete, immutable directories under
`tasks/<id>/v<N>-expanded/<token>/`, then atomically sets the existing
`task_versions.expanded_manifest_key` after checking the source hash and archive
key under the version-row lock. Publication does not delete or copy the previous
directory. Retain published directories for in-flight readers and presigned URLs;
also retain a candidate when commit acknowledgement is uncertain. Failed uploads
and positively identified stale candidates can be cleaned up separately. There is
no new schema migration or automatic backfill in this change.

`resolve_task_file_source` returns a `TaskFileSource` snapshot containing version,
archive prefix, published manifest key, and content hash from one authorized query.
All hosted, standalone, and public file routes pass that snapshot through. Only
database-selected immutable directories bypass legacy manifest validation. Existing
`v<N>-files/` layouts retain their checks; missing individual members still fall
back to the archive. Listing responses (including the first NDJSON chunk) and file
responses carry `source_hash` for the contents selected by the database.

Task listings also accept repeated `directories` parameters (1–8 paths; an empty
path means root), with `recursive=false&inline=false&presign=false`. Each directory
gets its own first page and continuation cursor under `directories`; `limit` is
per directory. Batch mode refuses `prefix`, `cursor`, and streaming. Hosted,
standalone, and token-scoped public routes share this contract. Storage resolves
and validates one source for the batch, then lists the bounded pages concurrently;
archive-only sources are loaded once. Existing single-directory and recursive
CLI responses are unchanged.

`useTaskFileTree` owns the browser directory cache, scoped by user/organization
(or the public token URL), task, version, and known content hash. The first batch
contains root, solution, tests, and environment, at 100 entries each; other
sections, wrappers, and continuation pages use the original listing API. Task-name
hover and keyboard focus prefetch that task's directory bundle after 150 ms; opening
the drawer consumes the same SWR request. Reopening reuses data for 30 seconds,
then refreshes; panel hash changes invalidate the revision. An older server's
root-only response remains usable. File/line selection stays in the existing URL
owners, and an addressed file reads directly before its directory tree finishes.
Directory completion must not emit file-selection callbacks or clear line anchors.
The browser opts into `previews=true`: at most 16 files, 32 KiB each and 256 KiB
combined, selected only from the requested pages with `instruction.md` first.
Storage reads previews concurrently and gives each read one second; failed, binary,
large, and omitted members retain on-demand reads. Cached archive text needs no
additional storage request. Hosted definition routes combine current organization
approval with exact task/version source selection in one SQL statement for ordinary
credentials; bound analysis credentials retain additional resource checks. Cached
publisher-owned `vN-revisions/<32-hex-token>/` archives skip HEAD only while their
bytes remain cached. Legacy mutable archives still revalidate.
See `docs/batched-file-loading.md` for the contract and local verification.

File-list request state records the requested and received content fingerprints.
Late task details do not abort a pending listing just to add a previously unknown
fingerprint; a differing fingerprint still invalidates the listing. The response
fingerprint resolves the race whether details or the listing finish first. URL
selection and line anchors retain their existing ownership.
Selected-file previews keep their own requested/received fingerprint using the
same revision bookkeeping. A late matching panel hash must not change the body
request key or clear the preview; a differing body hash still triggers a fresh
read. Preserve `source_hash` through previews, binary URLs, and full-file reads.

Storage HEAD/GET/body-read/LIST/DELETE and archive parsing have named timing phases.
`backend.request.phases` includes storage operation counts, downloaded/archive bytes,
archive-cache hit/miss, file source, and known file bytes. SDK failures log only
selected provider diagnostics, never request headers or file contents. Existing
Clerk login resolves organization and GitHub data between database sessions, then
rechecks organization/user rows before writing. The write session locks the
observed user, rejects membership removal during HTTP, and applies fetched GitHub
data only when the stored identity fields still match the pre-fetch snapshot.
No login Clerk HTTP request may
hold a database connection or provisioning lock. Membership callbacks retain their
existing transaction ownership. Identity provisioning suppresses automatic relationship loads in its own queries;
organization isolation, role refresh, and new-user provisioning remain unchanged.
See `docs/task-file-latency.md` for the staged verification checklist.

### Task Browser Summary

The default `GET /tasks/browse` path selects and paginates tasks before card
enrichment. Ordering and exact card counters come from the selected
`tasks.current_version_id` row in `task_version_browse_summaries`; there is no
fallback scan over organization trial history when a summary row is missing.
The visible cards then fetch at most 24 current-version trials per task through
a lateral query. `latest_trials_truncated` tells the frontend that the preview
is shorter than the exact `total_trials`.

Summary scope matches normal task cards: exclude probes, superseded attempts,
soft-deleted trials, and `combine:` copies. Any mutation that changes that
population or its metrics must call
`refresh_task_browse_summaries` inside the same transaction. This includes
trial create/import, start/reset, completion, cancellation, retry/supersede,
scoped deletion, and default-version selection. Trial-count thresholds,
including OR-groups, use the same current-version
summary as the cards and do not join the on-demand trial aggregate. Advanced
aggregate filters, comparisons, and non-default aggregate sorts intentionally
retain their on-demand trial aggregation path.

The pre-trial audit enqueue claims `pre_trial_status IS NULL` with one conditional
UPDATE, in the same transaction as audit creation. It must not upgrade the version
to `FOR UPDATE` after trial inserts have taken foreign-key `KEY SHARE` locks.

Refreshes serialize per version with sorted transaction-scoped PostgreSQL
advisory locks; do not replace those locks with `FOR UPDATE` on
`task_versions`, because concurrent trial inserts already hold foreign-key
`KEY SHARE` locks and lock upgrades can deadlock.

## `oddish/` — Core Package

### Install Extras

The base `pip install oddish` is CLI-only (light deps). Use extras for server and worker use cases:

```bash
pip install oddish            # CLI only — typer, httpx, pydantic, harbor
pip install oddish[server]    # + FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, alembic, aioboto3
pip install oddish[worker]    # + server + LLM provider SDKs
pip install oddish[all]       # everything including dev tools
```

### Entry Points

- CLI: `oddish` → `oddish.cli:app`
- API server: `python -m oddish.server` (requires `oddish[server]`)
- Standalone worker: `python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker` (requires `oddish[worker]`)
- DB helper CLI: `python -m oddish.db` (requires `oddish[server]`)
- Doc-store MCP server: `oddish-docstore-mcp` (see `oddish/src/oddish/mcp/README.md`)

Keep model-routing imports in `oddish.config` lazy: Harbor's utility modules
load LiteLLM, which fetches a pricing table during import. Help and local version
commands must print without loading it or accessing the network. The CLI CI job
runs `oddish/tests/startup` in fresh processes, with a three-second first-stdout
budget and a separate deterministic import/network guard.

### Soft Delete

Every model that mixes in `TimestampedMixin` has a `deleted_at` column, but
only classes registered through `oddish.db.soft_delete.register_soft_delete_models`
participate in the session-level auto-filter:

| Package | Soft-deletable models |
|---------|------------------------|
| `oddish.db.models` | `ExperimentModel`, `TaskModel`, `TrialModel`, `TagModel`, `TagAssignmentModel`, `TagExclusionModel`, `TagGrantModel`, `SavedTagFilterModel`, `SkillModel`, `DocumentModel` |
| `backend.models` | `OrganizationModel`, `UserModel`, `APIKeyModel` |

Behavior:

- ORM `SELECT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` issued through a session pick up
  `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` automatically, including eager-loaded
  relationships and aliased subqueries.
- The deletion helpers in `oddish.core.endpoints.deletion` (`delete_task_core`,
  `delete_experiment_core`, `delete_trial_core`) tombstone rows via
  `UPDATE ... SET deleted_at = NOW()` and cancel any matching `worker_jobs`
  rows. They return an empty `s3_prefixes` list so caller S3 cleanup is a
  no-op — S3 data is preserved for restore.
- `unlink_task_from_experiment_core` (same module) is the *scoped* sibling:
  it tombstones only the `task_experiments` join row for one
  `(task_id, experiment_id)` pair plus that experiment's trials for the task,
  and **never** the task row — so a *shared* task can be pulled out of one
  experiment without disturbing the others. It also fires the
  membership-removed tag hook so inherited EXPERIMENT tags drop.
- The `task_experiments` join table also carries `deleted_at`. Because it is a
  SQLAlchemy `Table`, not a registered model, live membership queries and
  relationship joins must explicitly include `task_experiments.deleted_at IS NULL`.
- Raw `text()` SQL doesn't run through the ORM listener; the dispatcher claim
  path (`worker_job_single_job.py`), cleanup sweep, and admin diagnostics each
  add `deleted_at IS NULL` inline.
- The `(org_id, name)` uniqueness on `tasks` is a **partial** unique index
  (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`) so a deleted task's name slot is reusable.
- To read or rewrite tombstoned rows, opt out per statement:
  `session.execute(stmt.execution_options(include_deleted=True))`.

### Worker Runtime (`oddish.workers.queue`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `worker_job_dispatcher.py` | `discover_active_worker_job_queue_keys`, `get_worker_job_org_queue_counts`, `build_spawn_plan` (org-first fair-share, with within-org round-robin across queue_keys) |
| `worker_job_single_job.py` | `_CLAIM_WORKER_JOB_SQL`, `run_single_worker_job`, `heartbeat_worker_job` |
| `trial_handler.py` | TRIAL execution body |
| `task_expand_handler.py` / `tag_project_handler.py` | TASK_EXPAND and TAG_PROJECT job bodies |
| `cleanup.py` | Zombie reaper, stale-heartbeat sweep, stage safety nets, **per-slot** orphaned-slot release (see invariants below) |
| `slots.py` | `queue_slots` lease acquire/release (`locked_by` / `locked_until` / `locked_at`) |
| `queue_manager.py` | Per-queue-key concurrency bookkeeping, `run_polling_worker` |
| `worker.py` | Standalone poll loop (`python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker`) |

Auxiliary modules (`concurrency_controller.py` (deprecated — see admin
overrides), `db_helpers.py`, `job_tokens.py`, `runtime_status.py`, `shared.py`,
`trial_failures.py`) support these.

Handler registration lives in `oddish.workers.jobs` (`registry.py`,
`handlers.py`). Both the standalone worker and the backend call
`ensure_builtin_handlers_registered()` at startup.

### Trace context across queued work

The API's active W3C trace context is saved in the existing
`worker_jobs.payload._oddish_trace_context` field. This field contains only
`traceparent` and optional `tracestate`, never baggage, credentials, or task
contents. The shared enqueue helper adds it after handler validation and
preserves it when a saved payload is requeued. The runner removes it from the
in-memory projection passed to handlers; the saved row keeps it for retries.
It is not part of sweep identity
or a deduplication key; no database migration is needed.

Hosted and core Logfire configuration explicitly enable `distributed_tracing`
so incoming request parents are accepted without the SDK's default warning.
Each claimed attempt creates an `oddish.worker_job.execute` consumer span from
that saved parent. The span covers the handler, outcome write, and completion
hooks. It records the job and subject IDs, attempt, retry decision, and queue
outcome without raw failure messages. Context is detached before the worker
claims another job. Older rows without a parent still run and start a new trace.
Jobs created by a separate recovery pass use that pass's active trace; this
change does not infer a missing historical parent from task or trial IDs.

Controllers that invoke the CLI can set `ODDISH_TRACE_CONTEXT` to a JSON object
with W3C `traceparent` and optional `tracestate`. The CLI forwards validated
headers only through its authenticated API clients. Direct presigned storage
uploads and downloads use separate clients and do not receive these headers.
Missing or malformed context is ignored. This input needs a CLI release that
contains the change; API-to-worker propagation needs matching API and worker
deployments with tracing enabled. Neither path forwards a Logfire token.

### Local Development

You need a running Postgres instance. Start one however you prefer (e.g.
`docker run -d --name oddish-db -e POSTGRES_USER=oddish -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=oddish -e POSTGRES_DB=oddish -p 5432:5432 postgres:16-alpine`),
then:

```bash
cd oddish
cp env.example .env
uv sync --extra server
uv run python -m oddish.db setup
uv run python -m oddish.server
```

That gives you the API on `http://localhost:8000` with background workers
started by the API process. Point the CLI at it with
`export ODDISH_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"`. For the hosted Oddish API
instead, keep the default API URL and set `ODDISH_API_KEY="ok_..."`.

`python -m oddish.server` auto-starts workers by default. For separate worker
processes (scaling or debugging): `uv run python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker`.

### Database Commands

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.db init    # run Alembic migrations
uv run python -m oddish.db setup   # alias for init
uv run python -m oddish.db reset   # drop and recreate all tables
uv run python -m oddish.db purge   # delete data, preserve migration state
```

### API Server Flags

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
uv run python -m oddish.server --n-concurrent '{"openai/gpt-5.2": 8, "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5": 8}'
```

### HTTP Endpoints (core standalone server)

Routes registered in `oddish/src/oddish/server/__init__.py`. The hosted backend
exposes a superset (org-scoped, plus documents/tags/skills/orgs/api-keys/admin
extensions) — see `backend/README.md`.

| Area | Endpoints |
|------|-----------|
| Health / dashboard | `GET /health`, `GET /dashboard` |
| Task upload | `POST /tasks/upload/init` (returns presigned PUT URL), `POST /tasks/upload/complete` |
| Trial import | `POST /trials/import/init`, `POST /trials/import/complete` (extracts and validates before best-effort staging cleanup; replay reuses an already-extracted prefix) |
| Sweeps | `POST /tasks/sweep`, `POST /tasks/sweep/batch` |
| Tasks | `GET /tasks`, `GET /tasks/browse`, `GET /tasks/browse/experiment-options` (typeahead for the experiment filter; `facets.experiments` is deprecated/always empty; the other facet lists are served from the `trial_facets` vocabulary — write-through on trial creation plus a periodic rebuild sweep, see `oddish/src/oddish/core/trial_facets.py`), `GET /tasks/{task_id}`, `GET /tasks/{task_id}/open`, `GET /tasks/{task_id}/detail`, `GET /tasks/{task_id}/versions[/{version}]`, `PUT /tasks/{task_id}/versions/{version}/default`, `POST /tasks/cancel` (optional `experiment_id` scopes the cancel to that experiment's trials so shared tasks keep running elsewhere) |
| Task QA | `POST /tasks/{task_id}/qa/retry`, `POST /tasks/{task_id}/qa/cancel`, `POST /tasks/{task_id}/qa/backfill` |
| Experiments | `POST /experiments/combine`, `PATCH /experiments/{experiment_id}` |
| Trials | `GET /tasks/{task_id}/trials/{index}`, `POST /trials/{trial_id}/retry` (optional `registry_auth` body), `GET /trials/{trial_id}/live` ((attempt, seq)-cursor live transcript), `GET /trials/{trial_id}/logs[/structured]`, `GET /trials/{trial_id}/trajectory`, `GET /trials/{trial_id}/result` |
| Files | `GET /tasks/{task_id}/files[/{path}]` (`inline=false` omits listing bodies; `presign=false` omits URLs; `max_bytes=N` caps archive-backed file reads), `GET /trials/{trial_id}/files[/{path}]`, `GET /trials/{trial_id}/debug-files` |
| Admin diagnostics | `GET /admin/slots`, `GET /admin/queue-status`, `GET /admin/orphaned-state`, `GET /admin/queue-health` |
| Public sharing | `/public/experiments...` router from `oddish.core.sharing.public` |

The core server has **no DELETE routes**. Deletion endpoints
(`DELETE /experiments/{id}`, `DELETE /experiments/{id}/tasks/{task_id}`,
`DELETE /trials/{trial_id}`) exist only on the hosted backend (admin-gated) and
call the shared `oddish.core.endpoints.deletion` helpers.

Public share links use 256-bit `public_token` values and are access-by-link, not
enumerable. The unauthenticated `/public/experiments` list intentionally returns
no share tokens. Public task/trial/live/file routes must stay scoped under
`/public/experiments/{public_token}/...` and verify membership in that shared
experiment; do not reintroduce `/public/tasks/{task_id}` or
`/public/trials/{trial_id}` ID-only access. Unpublishing an experiment clears
`public_token`, so republishing mints a fresh link and old URLs stay revoked.
Capability evidence links on a share page must remain inside `/share/{token}`;
they select the shared task and trial, open the trajectory tab, and retain the
cited step anchor. They must never point signed-out readers at authenticated
`/tasks/...` routes.

Authenticated experiment task rows include `verdict.primary_issue`, a preview
limited to 240 characters in the task query, falling back to verdict reasoning
when the primary issue is empty or absent, plus nullable top-level
`must_fix_count` from the current version's completed source audit. The full
report stays in task detail; public experiment rows retain the verdict label,
acceptance flag, and confidence without the prose preview or must-fix count.

Experiment pages use one `/experiments/{id}/results` NDJSON response (or the
public token-scoped equivalent). It contains experiment metadata, individual task
and trial records, and an explicit completion record. There are no page limits or
cursor requests in the browser. Each collection is read with one query inside a
repeatable-read, read-only transaction, closed on completion or disconnect. The
database driver buffers each collection; serialization streams individual records.
Public projections and
model aliases match the existing public endpoints. Member and public Next proxies
pass the response body through without buffering. The client paints incoming records
once per animation frame, validates completion/counts, and keeps partial rows with
Retry after interruption. Graphs require a complete response. Active experiments
refresh the complete response every 30 seconds and retain the previous complete
snapshot while refreshing. A failed refresh leaves that snapshot complete and its
graphs visible, exposes Retry, and keeps the 30-second refresh timer running.
An interrupted initial download remains incomplete. Task rows and the Cost/New
Spend cards omit the “not real” spend-exclusion badge; accounting exclusions are
unchanged.

The older `/open` and `/trial-page` APIs remain available for existing clients.
The first `/open` page includes the exact experiment summary; later pages request
`include_summary=false` and receive `summary=null` so they do not repeat the
whole-experiment aggregation. `/focus?task=...&trial=...` resolves one URL target
without walking either cursor. Authenticated focus reads retain addressability
for an experiment's historical, superseded, probe, and non-agent trials even
though those rows stay absent from its grid. Public pages use the matching
token-scoped focus route and retain the grid visibility rules, including the
probe exclusion, plus `/cost-totals`; paginated trial rows are never treated as
final spend or token totals.

Share links hide QA by default. `experiments.show_qa` stores the setting.
`POST /experiments/{id}/publish` accepts an optional `show_qa` boolean and
can change it on an existing link without changing its token. A request
with no setting keeps the stored choice. The share status and public
experiment metadata both return `show_qa`. Public task and trial responses
remove QA findings, verdicts, status, errors, times, and costs when it is off.
When it is on, `GET /public/experiments/{token}/tasks/{id}/qa` returns the
source checks for the task's displayed trial version. An optional `version`
query selects a version used by a live, non-probe trial in that share, or
the displayed task version when the share has no trials yet.
The route returns 404 when QA is off or the task/version is outside the link.
Public QA has no edit or run controls; org/admin checks still guard publishing.

### Configuration and model routing

Settings are loaded from `oddish/.env`; see `oddish/env.example`,
`backend/.env.example`, and `frontend/env.example` for the complete env surface.
Keep these routing rules in sync with `oddish/src/oddish/config.py` and
`oddish/src/oddish/workers/harbor/runner.py`:

- Thunder is an explicit, opt-in GPU backend. `ODDISH_THUNDER_ENABLED=true`
  registers it; `ODDISH_THUNDER_MAX_CAPACITY` (default 128) is a provider-wide
  limit enforced by durable leases across every organization, model, queue key,
  and Harbor variant. The `oddish-thunder` Modal secret contains only
  `TNR_API_URL` and `TNR_API_TOKEN` and is attached only to dedicated Thunder
  workers and teardown control. Thunder targets `thunder-sandbox==0.7.3` and
  its native async Python transport; never add subprocess probes or package
  requirements for `ssh`, `scp`, or `ssh-keygen` on its behalf. Registration
  makes `environment=thunder` valid and places Thunder between Daytona and
  Modal in `ordered_backends()`, so unspecified GPU work defaults to Thunder
  on a Thunder-enabled deployment (and to Modal elsewhere), while a
  submission carrying `registry_auth` (a private-registry pull, which Thunder
  cannot serve) stays on Modal. The CLI never names a GPU backend itself: it
  sends `requires_gpu` and the task's GPU types (an exact `gpu_type`
  environment kwarg, else the task.toml `gpu_types` list) for a GPU request
  and lets `backend/cloud_policy.py` negotiate against the deployment's own
  registry, where a `gpu_type` kwarg in the request itself wins the same way. Plain CPU work must keep defaulting to Daytona. Harbor's Thunder
  environment requires exactly one `[environment].gpu_types` entry (or a
  `gpu_type` kwarg) and a GPU count of 1, 2, 4, or 8, which `ThunderBackend`
  declares as `GpuSupport.requires_named_accelerator`; negotiation therefore
  sends a task naming no type, several types, or one Thunder lacks to Modal
  directly. GPU tasks with another count must pass `--env modal` explicitly.
  Oddish forces each Thunder sandbox name to its durable `sandbox_runs.id`.
  The reconciler inventories Thunder through a credential-scoped Modal
  function and treats that exact name match as the ownership proof needed to
  recover a handle lost before Harbor's `environment-provisioned` event. Never
  make the name task-configurable or terminate unmatched inventory entries.
  Two handoffs move a Thunder trial to `ODDISH_THUNDER_FALLBACK_PROVIDER`
  (default `modal`); their policy lives only in
  `oddish/workers/queue/thunder_fallback.py`, and both are expressed as
  `JobOutcome.reroute_to` and persisted by the one atomic transaction in
  `worker_job_single_job._record_reroute_outcome`. Capacity fallback remains
  off unless `ODDISH_THUNDER_CAPACITY_FALLBACK=true`: an exact SDK
  `sandbox_capacity_unavailable` result bypasses ordinary trial failure
  settlement, the END hook defers terminal state for it, and the handoff
  requires the same RUNNING trial and worker ownership in both validation and
  the SQL update. The attempt-budget fallback is on by default: once a trial
  has failed `ODDISH_THUNDER_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS` (default 2; 0 disables)
  attempts on Thunder, the retry that ordinary settlement already marked
  (trial RETRYING, worker released) is scheduled on the fallback provider with
  its ordinary retry delay. Every attempt of a Thunder trial ran on Thunder
  (`trials.environment` only ever leaves Thunder), so `trials.attempts` is that
  count; any retryable failure counts, so the worst case is the pre-Thunder
  routing. A declined attempt-budget handoff records the plain retryable
  failure (the trial keeps retrying on Thunder) and must never force a settled
  trial to FAILED. One ownership-checked transaction changes the trial
  environment plus required runnable/claim state and moves the job from
  `thunder_trial` to the `default` execution lane. Payload, queue key, Harbor
  variant, priority, attempt identifiers and limits, and stored trial config
  remain unchanged. At destination execution, Oddish rebuilds a private Harbor
  environment config: Thunder-only kwargs are removed from both override and
  task config, an exact Thunder `gpu_type` is transferred to the task's native
  GPU field, and backend capabilities are checked before provisioning. Modal
  must reject A6000 rather than remap it. A no-ID ledger is fast-finalized, and
  an attempt that failed before its ledger row existed (credential or task
  preparation) moves with nothing to tear down as long as the job carries no
  provider handle either; a provisioned `RUNNING` run is eligible for handoff,
  but any run with an external ID remains claim-blocked and retains its Thunder
  capacity lease until cleanup confirms teardown and clears
  `reroute_pending_teardown`.
  Rejected capacity handoffs settle a still-owned worker attempt and its
  still-owned RUNNING trial as FAILED, preserving provider handles and capacity
  leases for cleanup; cancellation and newer attempts are never overwritten. Modal fallback
  translates Thunder A100XL to A100-80GB and SDK A100 to A100-40GB only when
  Modal is the destination. Both the trial and worker-job attempt budgets are
  checked from locked current rows before a handoff. If either is exhausted,
  the owned attempt fails without scheduling a destination retry; source handles
  and leases remain available to cleanup.
  Requested/pending/completed/rejected/failed handoffs of either kind emit
  structured `metric=thunder_handoff` logs (with `handoff=<reason code>`) and
  the bounded `oddish.thunder.handoffs` counter, whose `handoff` attribute is
  the reason code. Both handoffs need the `thunder_fallback_001` core
  migration.
- EC2 is an explicit, opt-in Harbor backend: `ODDISH_EC2_ENABLED=true` registers
  it and permits hosted `environment=ec2`, but capability ordering keeps Daytona
  as the CPU default. V1 launches one ephemeral CPU instance per trial and uses
  public-IP, key-only SSH. It does not support accelerators, attach/retain mode,
  private networking, Spot, or AWS infrastructure provisioning.
- An EC2 deployment must provide an existing Ubuntu-compatible AMI, subnet,
  security group, EC2 key pair/private key, region, and instance type. The
  security group must allow TCP/22 from the Modal worker network path. Keep
  `ODDISH_EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` in the dedicated worker secret, materialize it
  mode `0600`, and never bake it into an image or attach it to API, dispatcher,
  or reconciler functions.
- EC2 control credentials must be least privilege: workers need
  `sts:GetCallerIdentity` plus launch, describe, image lookup, tagging, and
  termination actions; reconciliation needs `sts:GetCallerIdentity`, describe,
  and tag-scoped termination. Store them under the namespaced
  `ODDISH_EC2_AWS_*` settings; workers materialize a mode-`0600` AWS profile and
  scrub the raw values before starting Harbor. API cancellation delegates to a
  dedicated Modal teardown function, so API and dispatcher containers receive
  neither EC2 control nor SSH secrets. An optional platform-owned
  `ODDISH_EC2_INSTANCE_PROFILE` may be attached; it is visible to tenant code,
  so keep it task-scoped and grant the control identity `iam:PassRole` only for
  that role. Oddish always requires IMDSv2 so cloud-init can retrieve the EC2
  launch key: the response hop limit is one without an instance profile and two
  when a profile is explicitly exposed to Docker containers.
- Oddish does not create the VPC, subnet, security group, AMI, key pair, or IAM
  policy. Every instance and root volume must carry protected Oddish ownership,
  deployment, task/trial, worker-job, worker-attempt, sandbox-run, unguessable
  launch-token, and Harbor-session tags. A durable `sandbox_runs` row is created
  before launch; Harbor's `environment-provisioned` event binds the structured
  handle before SSH/bootstrap. The locked Harbor exposes that event natively;
  ephemeral pins that predate it are bridged by wrapping
  `EC2Environment._launch_instance` and emitting the same identity immediately
  after launch. A pin whose EC2 environment does not expose the required launch
  seam fails before `Job.run()` rather than launching untracked provider state.
  Normal teardown, cancellation, stale-heartbeat cleanup, and reconciliation
  terminate only after the full ledger/tag tuple agrees.
- EC2 orphan reconciliation snapshots deployment-tagged instances before the
  shared cleanup transaction, evaluates worker liveness using the database clock,
  and terminates only after the transaction commits. It preserves live linked
  jobs and conservatively preserves unlinked trial startup for 30 minutes, then
  reaps terminal and stale owners with an exact ledger match; missing or
  mismatched ledgers are ownership refusals, never destructive guesses. The
  protected 14-hour hard maximum age overrides worker liveness only for exactly
  owned instances. `ODDISH_EC2_MAX_CONCURRENT_INSTANCES` is enforced globally
  with heartbeat-renewed `sandbox_capacity_leases`, independent of model/variant
  queue slots. The dispatcher budgets against live EC2 leases before spawning,
  while each worker still acquires the lease atomically before claiming a job.
  A successful inventory snapshot also closes `PROVISIONING` / `TERMINATING`
  ledger rows that have no provider identity, no running owner, no matching
  inventory tags, and are older than the 30-minute launch-race grace. Capacity
  cleanup reruns after that transaction commits so those rows cannot reserve
  slots forever; an inventory failure never authorizes this finalization.
  Inventory and termination failures stay visible in logs/metrics while the rest
  of queue cleanup continues.
- Claude Code currently prefers the direct Anthropic API whenever
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is available because
  `ODDISH_CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_DIRECT_API` defaults to `1`. Set the flag to `0`
  to restore the Modal image's Bedrock route (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`).
  Bedrock model aliases must normalize to an invokable inference profile
  (`global.` / `us.` / ARN) via `to_bedrock_model_id`. The separate
  `anthropic-hdo/<model>` prefix always uses `ANTHROPIC_HDO_API_KEY` and blanks
  Bedrock routing for that trial.
  The ephemeral Claude Code runner applies this credential precedence when building
  its child payload: routing sees the trial's Anthropic key, and HDO wins over
  user and worker keys even when the HDO key is missing. The child receives
  the selected key and matching model/Bedrock settings through the private
  payload. Temporary worker-environment changes end before the child starts.
- OpenAI-family jobs default to Azure OpenAI. Use
  `ODDISH_OPENAI_PROVIDER=openai` plus `OPENAI_API_KEY` only when intentionally
  routing to public OpenAI.
- z.ai, MiniMax, Moonshot/Kimi, Fireworks, xAI, Meta, Geometric, and Anthropic
  HDO each have explicit canonical provider prefixes and queue keys: `zai/`,
  `minimax/`, `moonshot/`, `fireworks/`, `xai/`, `meta/`, `geometric/`, and
  `anthropic-hdo/`. Add or change provider aliases in `config.py`, then update
  env injection in the Harbor runner and the network allowlist notes.
- Google Vertex AI is the `vertex_ai/<model>` provider (aliases `vertex/`,
  `vertex-ai/`, `google-vertex/`) for Gemini and Claude alike; the bare id
  passes through untouched. It is agent-agnostic: `workers/harbor/vertex_ai.py`
  publishes one standard Vertex environment (the Gen AI SDK, Gemini CLI,
  LiteLLM, AI SDK, and Claude Code variables, the credential path, and blanks
  for the competing Bedrock, Gemini-key, and OAuth selectors) to every
  `vertex_ai/` trial; whether a harness honors it is the harness's business.
  Settings: `VERTEX_AI_CREDENTIALS_JSON` + `VERTEX_AI_PROJECT_ID` (a service
  account; an `AGENT_START` hook uploads the key as
  `/tmp/oddish-vertex/service-account.json`, since Modal and Daytona never
  fire the provisioned callback), optional `VERTEX_AI_API_KEY` (an express-mode
  key, published as a `${VERTEX_AI_API_KEY}` template; alone it selects
  Gemini-only express mode), and `VERTEX_AI_LOCATION` (default `global`);
  hosted deploys mount them from the `oddish-vertex` secret
  (`ODDISH_VERTEX_SECRET_NAME`). Host-side harnesses read the worker's
  `VERTEXAI_CREDENTIALS`, so a GKE worker keeps its own ADC. The
  `ODDISH_VERTEX_AI_MODE` marker counts only with a canonical `vertex_ai/` id,
  so a submitted marker cannot widen another provider's restricted trial;
  verifier judge spend attributes to the `other` route. The profile also pins
  `GOOGLE_CLOUD_QUOTA_PROJECT`, so a key minted in another project still
  bills the configured one. Live on `vertex_ai/gemini-3.8-flash`: gemini-cli
  (Daytona, Modal, closed network, override Harbor), terminus-2, and
  antigravity-cli pass; antigravity's Oddish wrapper turns on agy's ADC mode
  for the service-account profile (marker plus credential file; express mode
  stays on agy's key path) unless the run sets `AGY_ADC_AUTH` itself, and
  defaults `reasoning_effort` to `high` for Gemini 3 models
  (`--ak reasoning_effort=...` overrides), so `-m vertex/<model>` needs no
  flags; the name matches `AUTH`, so a literal `AGY_ADC_AUTH` value is
  redacted to `****` at persistence and fails agy's boolean parse on the
  worker: opt out with `--ae 'AGY_ADC_AUTH=${AGY_ADC_AUTH:-false}'`, whose
  template survives; restricted networks grant agy's ADC egress on the
  service-account profile, captured live (`oauth2.googleapis.com` for the
  token, the location's endpoint for the model calls, agy's startup probes;
  proven on the `global` location): the Compose and kube shapes take that
  set from the antigravity profile, which still refuses an
  `AGY_ADC_AUTH=true` with no such profile behind it, while the Daytona and
  Modal single-container shape infers the same hosts from the model and
  agent without consulting the profile; the override-Harbor child runs
  stock Harbor and still needs
  `--ae 'AGY_ADC_AUTH=${GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI}'` plus
  `--ak reasoning_effort=<level>` for Gemini 3; antigravity reports no
  token usage;
  mini-swe-agent lacks `google-auth` in its Harbor install, swe-agent fails
  before any model call on tasks without `/testbed`, opencode wants its own
  `google-vertex/` spelling, and the other harnesses ignore the profile.
- Geometric is Oddish's own self-hosted vLLM endpoint, currently serving
  GLM-5.3. It exposes **both** API shapes from one server, and the route is
  chosen by harness, not by model id: `mini-swe-agent` gets the OpenAI shape
  (`OddishGeometricMiniSweAgent` hands litellm an `openai/<bare-id>` against
  `OPENAI_BASE_URL`), and `claude-code` gets the Anthropic shape
  (`_apply_claude_code_geometric_env` sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`). One
  `geometric/<id>` therefore keeps a single queue key and cost bucket across
  both. The two base URLs differ by design: litellm appends
  `/chat/completions` so `OPENAI_BASE_URL` carries the `/v1`, while Claude Code
  appends `/v1/messages` so `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` must not —
  `get_geometric_anthropic_base_url()` derives the latter by dropping a
  trailing `/v1`, overridable with `GEOMETRIC_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. So
  **`GEOMETRIC_BASE_URL` must end in `/v1`** — it is on the OpenAI side of the
  repo's base-URL split (as `META_BASE_URL` is), not the Anthropic side that
  `ZAI_BASE_URL`, `MINIMAX_BASE_URL`, `MOONSHOT_BASE_URL`, and
  `FIREWORKS_BASE_URL` sit on, where the root deliberately omits it. Setting it
  without the suffix breaks exactly one of the two routes: the derivation is a
  no-op so `claude-code` still resolves, while `mini-swe-agent` 404s against
  vLLM, which serves `/v1/chat/completions`. The result reads as an
  agent-specific bug rather than a misconfiguration, so check the suffix first
  when only one harness fails.
- Geometric is **prefix-only**: `is_zai_model` claims every bare `glm...` id, so
  a bare `glm-5.3` keeps routing to z.ai and selecting Geometric takes an
  explicit `geometric/glm-5.3` (or the `gm/` alias) — the same opt-in rule
  Fireworks uses to take over GLM/MiniMax/Kimi ids.
- Geometric is also the one provider with a **served-model allowlist**
  (`_GEOMETRIC_SERVED_MODELS`), because a vLLM process serves exactly one
  `--served-model-name`, and because `geometric/<foreign-id>` would otherwise
  reach litellm as `openai/<foreign-id>`, whose default route is public OpenAI.
  Enforcement lives at submit (`sweep.py`) and on the wire id
  (`require_geometric_served_model_id`), never in `normalize_trial_model`,
  which must stay total for reads over stored rows whose model has since left
  the set. Keep the set in sync with `--served-model-name`.
- Gemini model ids use the `gemini/<id>` prefix (the Gemini API key route,
  Google AI Studio; `vertex_ai/` is a separate provider, above). The same
  bare model runs on either route: the prefix alone decides the provider,
  queue key (`gemini/gemini-3.8-flash` vs `vertex_ai/gemini-3.8-flash`),
  credential (`GEMINI_API_KEY` vs the Vertex service account), and host
  (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com` vs `aiplatform.googleapis.com`).
  LiteLLM resolves the same way, by prefix, and a Vertex trial blanks the
  Gemini keys in its own env so a LiteLLM harness cannot drift between the
  two; a bare `gemini-…` id is rejected by LiteLLM and keeps Oddish's existing
  bare-id defaults. `_build_agent_config` hands
  each agent the spelling its LLM client expects (litellm agents in
  `_LITELLM_MODEL_ID_AGENTS`, Vercel AI SDK agents in
  `_AI_SDK_MODEL_ID_AGENTS`); add a new agent to the set matching its client.
- Dockerfile-only tasks on Modal, Daytona, and Archil support public setup
  followed by a restricted agent phase. Oddish adds the selected model and
  agent runtime hosts to the agent-phase allowlist and disables supported
  server-side web tools. This does not widen a restricted environment baseline:
  legacy `allow_internet=false` still blocks agent installation unless its
  dependencies are already available or explicitly allowed. Custom Compose
  tasks use the separate Daytona-only restricted-network profile.
- Kubernetes task charts that enforce their own runtime egress boundary can opt
  into Oddish's model-route bridge with a chart-root
  `.oddish-agent-egress-hosts` marker containing exactly
  `agentEgressProxy.runtimeAllowedHosts`. Because EC2/k3s cannot perform
  Harbor's dynamic phase-policy switch, the task must retain a public
  environment baseline, omit formal agent/step network policies, and declare
  its stable task-owned proxy hosts in
  `metadata.oddish_agent_egress_allowed_hosts`. Before Harbor instantiates the
  environment, Oddish merges that task policy with the selected model and
  agent runtime hosts and explicit `extra_allowed_hosts` entries, then writes
  the resolved normalized policy as a semicolon-delimited value to
  `environment.kwargs.helm_values.agentEgressProxy.runtimeAllowedHosts`. That
  Helm key is reserved for Oddish: the chart must treat it as the authoritative
  runtime allowlist for its deny-by-default proxy, using chart defaults only
  when no hosted override is supplied. This chart contract accepts exact DNS
  hostnames only; wildcard, IP, and CIDR policies fail closed because the task
  proxy materializes concrete DNS and TLS/SNI routes. Charts without the
  declaration are untouched; Compose and single-container egress behavior
  remains on its existing paths.
- Provider secrets are referenced by env var name (`AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`,
  `ANTHROPIC_HDO_API_KEY`, `ZAI_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`,
  `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `META_API_KEY`,
  `VERTEX_AI_CREDENTIALS_JSON`, `VERTEX_AI_API_KEY`) and must not be persisted
  on trial rows. The Vertex service-account JSON never enters an agent env at
  all: only the sandbox file path does, and Harbor's env serializer would
  redact a literal under a CREDENTIAL-named key anyway. The uploaded file is
  readable inside the trial sandbox, the same trust boundary as the plaintext
  provider keys every trial carries in its env, so the deployment guidance is
  a dedicated, minimally scoped service account (see `SELF_HOSTING.md`).
- `grok-build` (xAI) writes a Grok CLI config whose `[model.*]` blocks pin an
  `api_backend`. Upstream Harbor hardcodes `responses` (`POST /v1/responses`),
  but not every xAI model is served there — some (e.g. newer/unreleased models)
  live only on Chat Completions and answer a Responses request with a 404
  `The model <id> does not exist or your team does not have access to it`.
  `OddishGrokBuild` accepts an `api_backend` kwarg
  (`chat_completions` | `responses` | `messages`); pass
  `--agent-kwarg api_backend=chat_completions` to route such a model. When
  unset, the upstream `responses` default is preserved.
  The wrapper also pins the grok CLI itself: `v9m-rl-learnability-tp8` 404s
  on current `install.sh` stable (1.0.13) even with `chat_completions`, and
  last worked on CLI 1.0.0 + Responses with Oddish's `grok -p` invocation.
  `OddishGrokBuild` therefore installs `1.0.0` for that model (override
  with `--agent-kwarg version=…`; empty `version` keeps whatever
  `install.sh` ships). `[cli] auto_update = false` so the pin cannot
  self-update mid-trial. Do not bypass the wrapper with Harbor stock
  `GrokBuild` on 1.0.0: that class runs `grok --single --session-id`,
  which 1.0.0 rejects (`Session ID is already in use`).
- `grok-build` trajectories come from the CLI's on-disk **session store**, not
  its headless stdout. `grok -p --output-format json|streaming-json` only emits
  the assistant's `text`/`thought` — no tool calls and no token usage — so
  `OddishGrokBuild` copies `$GROK_HOME/sessions/.../<id>/` into
  `/logs/agent/grok-session` after the run and converts `updates.jsonl`
  (ACP `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` / `agent_message_chunk`) plus
  `events.jsonl` usage into the ATIF trajectory + token `FinalMetrics`
  (`grok_build_session.py`). If the session store is missing it falls back to
  the text-only stdout trajectory. Do not "fix" trajectories by parsing stdout —
  the tool calls are only in the session store.
- The grok **live** transcript is the one reader that does parse stdout
  (`GrokBuildFold` in `live_tail.py` tails `/logs/agent/grok-build.json`): the
  session store is copied into the trial logs only after the run, so it cannot
  feed a live view. That panel is therefore text and reasoning only, with no
  tool calls and no running token/cost counters; it is not the trajectory and
  must not be used to build one.

Storage defaults:

- S3-compatible storage is **required**. Clients PUT task bundles directly
  to a presigned URL returned by `/tasks/upload/init` and then call
  `/tasks/upload/complete`.
- uploaded task bundles: normally `tasks/<task_id>/v<N>/.oddish-task.tar.gz`;
  in-place replacements use immutable
  `tasks/<task_id>/v<N>-revisions/<token>/.oddish-task.tar.gz` sources selected
  by `task_versions.task_s3_key` (legacy unversioned bundles remain readable)
- expanded per-file trees: the expand worker mirrors a bundle to
  `tasks/<task_id>/v<N>-files/` plus a `.oddish-manifest.json` sentinel and
  then stamps `task_versions.expanded_manifest_key` under the version row's
  lock; an in-place overwrite clears the stamp in the transaction that switches
  `task_s3_key`. `resolve_task_file_source` returns it as `expanded`.
  `False` skips the extracted tree; `True` and `None` still validate the
  manifest against the selected archive because an overwrite can replace
  the tree after the database read. Missing members fall back to the bundle.
- Recursive trial-file listings remain complete for CLI downloads; only
  non-recursive listings use `limit` and continuation cursors.
- Harbor job outputs: `/tmp/harbor-jobs`

- Modal workers also check `/mnt/oddish-tasks` before falling back to the S3 download path

EC2 canary procedure:

1. In a non-production AWS account, create the Ubuntu-compatible AMI, subnet,
   public-IP route, SSH security group, key pair, and least-privilege worker IAM
   credentials. Enable the backend with the `ODDISH_EC2_*` settings documented
   in `backend/.env.example`.
2. Submit a small CPU-only task with `oddish run <task> --env ec2 --background`.
   Confirm the trial records provider `ec2` and an external instance handle, and
   confirm the instance and root volume have the protected Oddish tags.
3. Verify SSH/bootstrap, Docker Compose execution, result/artifact collection,
   and terminal instance state. Confirm the instance has the configured IAM
   profile (or none), and that metadata is IMDSv2-only with response hop limit
   one without a profile or two with a profile.
4. Start a longer canary, cancel it with `oddish cancel <trial-or-task-id>`, and
   confirm the tagged instance terminates exactly once.
5. In the non-production deployment only, deliberately interrupt a worker after
   launch. Confirm stale-heartbeat/orphan reconciliation preserves it during the
   grace window and terminates it afterward. Also verify the hard maximum-age
   path. Review logs/metrics for the candidate, ownership decision, and terminate
   result before enabling production traffic.

## Repo-wide Gotchas

### Installed clients are always behind the server

The `oddish` CLI is installed from Homebrew and upgrades only when the user
runs `brew upgrade abundant-ai/tap/oddish`, so the live server always
serves clients one or more releases old. There is no server-side minimum
client version check; an incompatible change does not reject old clients, it
fails their tasks. Before editing a response schema, status enum, CLI
option, queue payload, or storage key under `oddish/`, search
`oddish/src/oddish/cli/`, the packaged skill references under
`oddish/src/oddish/assets/skills/oddish/references/`, `backend/`, and
`frontend/` for readers of it. Explain material compatibility effects and
relevant reader checks in the PR body's What changed section. Add fields
rather than renaming them, keep old values accepted for at least one release,
and never change the meaning of an existing value. The previously released CLI must keep working against the
new server; if it cannot, the PR body names the first client version that
breaks. The same applies to helpers other packages or open PRs import: check
callers before removing or re-signaturing them.

### Never expose probes in public/share views

Probes are an **experimental, internal-only** feature. They must never appear in
any public, unauthenticated surface — the `/share/[token]` experiment view, the
`/datasets/[token]` view, or any `/public/*` API response. Both public views are
fed by the same endpoints in `oddish/src/oddish/core/sharing/public.py`, so the
filtering lives at the **data layer** (don't return `is_probe` trials), not just
the UI:

- `get_public_task_for_experiment` (`sharing/helpers.py`) strips `is_probe` trials from the
  loaded task, covering `get_public_task_status`.
- The public `/open` and `/trial-page` resources reuse
  `visible_experiment_trial_predicates`, which excludes probes before rows are
  projected.
- `list_public_task_trials` always passes `probe=False` (never honors a
  caller-supplied probe filter publicly).

When adding a new public/share endpoint or surfacing a new trial/task field
publicly, exclude probes the same way. Filter at the query/data layer — UI
guards alone are not enough, since the trials still ship to the browser.

### `list_tasks_core` `load_only` and MissingGreenlet

`list_tasks_core` (`oddish/src/oddish/core/endpoints/tasks_query.py`) powers
the generic task-list routes. Its **compact path**
(`compact_trials=True`) restricts the trial/task/experiment selectin loads with
`load_only(...)`, which makes *only* the enumerated columns eager and defers
everything else. The bounded experiment `/trial-page` uses the separate
`_TRIAL_PAGE_COLUMNS` projection in `core/endpoints/experiment_page.py`.
Under async SQLAlchemy, reading a deferred column in a
response builder fires a lazy-load outside the request greenlet and 500s with
`sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenlet`.

So: whenever you surface a **new `TrialModel` / `TaskModel` / `ExperimentModel`
column in the FE** (i.e. read it in `build_trial_response`,
`build_compact_trial_response`, or `_build_task_status_response` in
`core/helpers.py`), you **must also add that column to the matching `load_only`
set** in each caller. The full builder has no `load_only`, so it will not catch
an omission. Builder unit tests cannot catch it either because in-memory models
have every attribute set; the bug lives in the query options, not the builder.

### Read sessions, the write guard, and statement budgets

Every statement is a network round trip to a pooler that sits a network hop
away from the API containers (measured 2026-09: 4 ms to 220 ms per trip
depending on where Modal placed the container), so the number of statements a
request issues is its latency budget. Three rules keep that number down:

- **GET handlers use `get_read_session()`** (`oddish/db/connection.py`). It
  checks the connection out in driver autocommit, so a read pays no `BEGIN`,
  `COMMIT`, or reset `ROLLBACK`. `get_session()` remains the write path. A
  read session **refuses to flush**: any pending ORM change raises
  `RuntimeError("get_read_session() is read-only ...")`, so a GET that grows a
  write fails in tests instead of autocommitting statement by statement. The
  GETs that write on purpose use `get_session()` for those writes:
  `tags.py` `get_policy` lazily inserts a default policy. The dashboard resolves
  author filters in a write transaction because a missing attribution profile
  saves discovered identities and reclaims unowned experiments. That transaction
  commits before a separate `get_read_session()` loads the dashboard, so the
  first Mine response includes newly claimed experiments.
- **Reads that tolerate a not-yet-migrated table go through
  `read_optional_table`** (`oddish/db/optional_read.py`). It opens a
  `SAVEPOINT` on write sessions and none on read sessions (PostgreSQL rejects
  `SAVEPOINT` under autocommit), returns `None` only for a missing table, and
  re-raises everything else. Do not hand-roll `begin_nested()` + `ProgrammingError`
  for this case again; the three former copies (cost exclusions, quota bumps,
  quota limits) all use the helper.
- **`oddish/tests/test_statement_budgets.py` pins statements per core** for
  the task, trial, detail, browse and experiment-page reads. Raise a budget only
  with a reason in the diff.

Pooled SQLAlchemy connections are idle in driver `AUTOCOMMIT` mode so the
asyncpg connection health check sends only its test command, without a
`BEGIN`/`ROLLBACK` pair. The exported engine is a `READ COMMITTED` view of
that same pool: `engine.begin()`, ordinary sessions, and writes retain their
transactions. Read sessions override the view for their checkout. The pool
size is unchanged; NullPool workers retain their existing configuration.

Two per-process caches take the remaining fixed costs off the request path:
`load_cost_exclusions` (`oddish/core/cost_exclusions.py`) refreshes at most once
per `ODDISH_COST_EXCLUSIONS_CACHE_SECONDS` (default 60; the admin routers call
`invalidate_cost_exclusions()` after every edit), and the backend auth cache
keeps Clerk identities for `ODDISH_AUTH_IDENTITY_TTL_SECONDS` (default 900)
while taking role and email from the freshly verified token on every hit. Both
use `oddish.cache.TTLCache`; new per-process caches should too.

### Dashboard pipeline stats use reserved queue keys


`get_queue_stats` / `get_queue_stats_by_org` (`oddish/src/oddish/queue.py`)
bucket trial counts by each trial's own `queue_key`, and the
trajectory-analysis / verdict pipeline counts under the **reserved**
`analysis` / `verdict` buckets (`ANALYSIS_PIPELINE_QUEUE_KEY` /
`VERDICT_PIPELINE_QUEUE_KEY` in `oddish/src/oddish/config.py`). Never key
pipeline counts off the analysis/verdict *model*'s queue key: that folds
pipeline state into a real model's bucket — an incident rendered 4k+ trials
mid-classification as "running workers" under one model's queue while that
model's actual trials were routed into the "analyses" pipeline. These are
presentation buckets only; QA/audit/analyzer trials queue under
`get_qa_queue_key()` (the analysis model's concurrency bucket) and are
excluded from the per-queue trial scans by `kind = 'agent'`.

Related invariant: a QA trial that dies retries like any trial; a terminal QA
trial whose import never landed is re-imported by the VERDICT_PENDING healer
in the cleanup sweep, which also creates a fresh QA trial when none exists.
Appending trials to a task cancels its in-flight QA trial (stamped with the
cancelled harbor_stage) so a stale import can't overwrite the new set's
verdict; the importer additionally refuses to store a verdict while any live
agent trial is non-terminal.

## `backend/` — Hosted Cloud Layer

### Authentication Model

The backend accepts auth from `Authorization`, `X-Clerk-Authorization`, or
`X-Authorization` (parsed in `backend/auth/__init__.py:get_auth_context`;
token verification lives in `backend/auth/verification.py`).

- **API keys** (`ok_...`): stored hashed (SHA-256) in `api_keys`; scopes are `full`, `tasks`, `read`
- **Clerk JWTs**: validated against Clerk JWKS; org context extracted from token claims

There are exactly two org roles: `admin` (manage users/settings) and `member`
(run evals, view results). New users default to `member`.

Auth flow: read token → if `ok_` prefix validate API key → otherwise validate Clerk JWT and resolve org/user → return `AuthContext`.

Short-lived internal READ keys may set `api_keys.bound_analysis_trial_id`. The
binding stores only the requesting analysis trial id; every request derives its
allowlist from that Trial row. QA and QA-eval keys may GET only Trial resources
whose ids appear in `harbor_config.analysis_payload.trial_ids`; a QA-eval
payload must contain exactly one non-empty source id or the key authorizes
nothing. Audit keys may
GET only `/tasks/{task_id}/files` resources for the analysis trial's exact
`task_version_id`, and the request must carry that pinned version number.
Summarize trials receive no query key. Bound keys fail closed on other routes
and on every non-GET request. Ordinary operator-probe keys remain unbound and
retain the existing organization-wide READ policy. Do not copy source ids or
task ids onto API-key rows and do not add analysis-only mirror endpoints.

API key creation is user-auth only (API-key auth is rejected so one key cannot
mint another) and is self-service for every org — any `admin` or `member` user
may create keys for their own org (`can_create_api_keys` /
`require_api_key_creator`). Admins may mint `full`, `tasks`, or `read` keys;
members may mint only `tasks` or `read` keys. Member-created `tasks` keys can
run task/trial workflows and read files, and can cancel in-flight runs, but are
blocked from broader org mutations such
as tagging, collections, documents, skills, and GitHub webhook updates. The
creator role is stamped on the API key at mint time so later role changes or
deleted creator rows do not broaden a member-created key.

Internal analysis API keys are additionally bound to the analysis trial that
requested them. QA and QA-eval keys may read only their stored source-trial
result, trajectory, and log routes, plus task files for the analysis trial's
exact `task_id` and `task_version_id`; the task-file request must include that
version number. Audit keys have the same exact-version task-file access.
Summarize keys receive no Oddish API reads, and every bound key is read-only.

If a Clerk JWT arrives without `org_id`, the backend tries to resolve a single existing org membership, or provisions a personal org.

### Worker Architecture

Dispatcher + reconciler + single-job pattern, backed by the unified
`worker_jobs` table. **Dispatch and reconciliation are deliberately separate
scheduled functions** so a slow or deadlocking reconciliation sweep can never
block worker spawning (previously they shared one function under a tight 60s
timeout; a sweep that timed out spawned zero workers that cycle, and a SIGKILL
mid-sweep left orphaned `idle in transaction` locks that deadlocked the next
sweep):

1. `poll_queue()` runs on a `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (30s) Modal schedule under
   `DISPATCHER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (120s). It only discovers active queue keys
   (`discover_active_worker_job_queue_keys`) and launches up to
   `MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL` single-job containers via the org-first fair-share
   `build_spawn_plan`. It runs no cleanup. `MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL` is the
   dominant throughput ceiling: long agent trials hold a `queue_slots` lease
   for their full duration, so steady-state running workers ≈
   `spawns_per_poll × trial_duration / poll_interval`. It must stay high enough
   to fill the per-model concurrency limits; the per-queue-key slot caps and
   `WORKER_MAX_CONTAINERS` remain the real bounds.
2. `reconcile_queue_state()` runs on its own `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (240s)
   schedule under a generous `CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (600s) so it is never
   SIGKILLed mid-transaction. Each phase is wrapped best-effort: stale
   `queue_slots` lease cleanup, `cleanup_orphaned_queue_state` (zombie-txn reap
   + stale-heartbeat sweep + stage safety nets + **per-slot** orphaned slot
   release — see invariants below), and the experiments owner backfill
   (`dashboard_owner_backfill`, which keeps the dashboard Mine filter on its
   indexed fast path). The display-hygiene clear of terminal-trial claim
   metadata (`clear_terminal_trial_runtime_refs`) runs after the main
   transaction commits, in batched `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` transactions, so it
   can neither deadlock against live workers nor roll back the sweep.
3. `process_single_job(queue_key)` adopts its reserved `queue_slots` lease
   (or acquires one for an unreserved invocation), stamping
   `locked_by = <worker_id>`, `locked_at = NOW()`, `locked_until = NOW() +
   WORKER_TIMEOUT + 30s`, and calls `run_single_worker_job` →
   `drain_worker_jobs`, which atomically claims one or more `worker_jobs` rows
   (stamping `current_worker_id`), dispatches to the registered handler for the
   row's kind, writes heartbeats on both `worker_jobs.heartbeat_at` and the
   mirrored domain column, records the outcome (`SUCCESS` / `RETRYING` /
   `FAILED` / `CANCELLED`), runs the post-success hook when applicable,
   releases the slot in its `finally`, and exits.
4. `send_slack_expense_notifications()` runs every five minutes in production
   when the webhook or the bot token is configured. It deterministically
   alerts for experiments at $1,000 and each additional $1,000 of spend, and
   for any recent trial over $200 -- the old "must exceed 2x the same-task/model
   peer average, with at least one peer" filter (`trial_average_multiplier`)
   is gone, so the $200 floor is unconditional. A trial over $1,000 produces
   two alerts: the owner's DM, plus a separate in-channel escalation
   (`trial-escalation:{id}`) mentioning the owner and the admin-editable
   always-ping list (see below). Both
   carry the ":rotating_light: *Very expensive trial*" heading in place of
   the usual ":warning: *Expensive trial*". Milestones are driven by *new*
   spend: spend that finished within the 2h watch window. Milestones already
   covered by the pre-window baseline (`total - recent`) are claimed and
   completed silently so first observing pre-existing spend never dumps
   historical alerts. Failed loud deliveries retain per-channel retry
   markers; primary and retry completion is atomic. Indeterminate loud claims
   are not repeated because the external channels do not offer an idempotency
   key, while interrupted silent claims are completed without sending.
   The in-channel escalation -- the $1,000 floor a trial must clear to post to
   the shared channel, plus the always-ping list -- is admin-editable at runtime
   from the Costs tab of `/admin`, backed by the single `slack_alert_settings`
   row (`PUT /admin/slack-alert-settings`, `require_admin`). The constants in
   `slack_alert_settings.py` are the defaults that stand when no row exists, and
   DELETE restores them. `load_alerts` reads the row once per run in a session
   of its own -- a missing table (deploy-before-migrate) falls back to the
   defaults rather than aborting the run's transaction. The escalation threshold
   is deliberately absent from the alert key: a key that embedded it would mint
   fresh dedup rows on each retune and re-alert the whole window. The per-user
   DM cutoffs -- the $1,000 milestone/repeat and the $200 trial floor -- are
   deploy-time constants (`DEFAULT_*_USD` in `user_alert_prefs.py`) that each
   person inherits until they override them in their own notification settings;
   they are not admin-editable. The 0.5 experiment-failed ratio stays a module
   constant in `slack_notifications.py` because it governs failure DMs, not
   spend. The five `ODDISH_SLACK_*` threshold env vars
   (`ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSIVE_EXPERIMENT_USD`, `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPERIMENT_REPEAT_USD`,
   `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSIVE_TRIAL_USD`, `ODDISH_SLACK_TRIAL_AVERAGE_MULTIPLIER`,
   `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPERIMENT_FAILED_RATIO`) remain gone. It uses the shared
   settled-cost basis and contains no agent/LLM path. It is on by default for
   the production app and off by default on preview apps; a preview opts in
   by setting `ODDISH_ENABLE_SLACK_EXPENSE_NOTIFICATIONS=true` and providing
   either `SLACK_EXPENSE_WEBHOOK_URL` or `SLACK_ALERT_BOT_TOKEN`, optionally
   through a preview-only named secret selected by
   `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSE_SECRET_NAME`. The email delivery channel
   (`RESEND_API_KEY`, `ODDISH_EXPENSE_EMAIL_FROM`, `send_owner_emails`,
   `_post_email`) has been deleted entirely.
   Cost alerts -- experiment milestones and expensive trials -- DM their
   experiment's owner; the email channel is gone. The only cost alert that
   still reaches the webhook is the over-$1,000 trial escalation, which
   carries an `<@...>` mention-line prefix resolved from the relevant emails.
   `send_alerts(webhook_url, alerts, *, bot_token=None)` claims each alert
   before resolving its mentions, so already-delivered alerts cost zero Slack
   lookups; a mention-lookup failure never sinks the underlying alert, it
   just posts without the prefix. The DM-only kinds (`dm_only=True`,
   delivered solely by `send_owner_dms`, never posted to the webhook) are
   experiment milestones, expensive trials, experiment-failed, trial-failed,
   and qa-failed. Trial-failed fires for any trial with
   `status == FAILED`, or `status == SUCCESS` with `result->>'harbor_exception'`
   set (a crashed agent still gets its verifier run, so the row lands as
   SUCCESS with an exception marker rather than FAILED); SKIPPED trials never
   match either arm, and soft-deleted, superseded (retried), and
   user-cancelled (`harbor_stage == 'cancelled'`) trials are additionally
   excluded via the existing `current_trial` predicate, gated on
   `finished_at >= recent_cutoff` (the same 2h window). Qa-failed fires for
   `verdict_status == SUCCESS` with `verdict->>'is_good' == 'false'`, or
   `verdict_status == FAILED` with a `verdict_error` other than the
   user-cancellation message `"Cancelled by user"` (cancellation also stamps
   FAILED and is not a QA failure), gated on
   `verdict_finished_at >= recent_cutoff`; its recipient is resolved through
   `TaskModel.created_by_user_id -> UserModel.email`. Both dedup on
   `alert.key` = `"trial-failed:{bucket}"` / `"qa-failed:{bucket}"` where
   `bucket` is the task version id (falling back to the task id on
   unversioned trials); `build_alerts` also collapses duplicate keys produced
   within a single run. The DM claim key is `"dm:{alert.key}:{recipient}"`,
   so each person is DMed at most once per task version, ever.

Endpoint health monitoring is hosted-only. `endpoint_health_worker.py` registers
an independent one-minute check schedule and hourly 30-day retention job;
`endpoint_health.py` owns explicit `ODDISH_ENDPOINT_MONITORS` configuration,
provider calls, database claims, and incident transitions. Production registers
these schedules by default; staging/previews require the deploy-time
`ODDISH_ENABLE_ENDPOINT_MONITORING=true` flag. No targets means unmonitored.
`endpoint_monitors` owns current state and expiring claim tokens;
`endpoint_checks` stores completed observations. Provider calls hold no DB
connection. Results update current state, append history, and write any Slack
outbox events in ONE transaction; late/duplicate claims are ignored. Reuse the
existing Slack sender rather than posting from the check loop. Two consecutive
provider failures open an incident, success resolves it, and internal check errors
cannot establish or resolve provider outages. Operator Admin's overview reads
one small current-state query; history is lazy and bounded. Configuration,
limits, delivery semantics, and isolated test instructions are in backend/README.md.

Handler registration happens at container load via
`ensure_builtin_handlers_registered()`. `_POST_SUCCESS_HOOKS` in
`worker/functions.py` contains only `notify_github_trial` for successful
`TRIAL` worker jobs. QA GitHub notifications use a separate import hook:
`register_qa_imported_hook(notify_github_qa)` refreshes the whole PR comment
(per-trial classifications plus the task verdict) after a QA trial's artifact
is imported. There is no `notify_github_analysis` hook or active task-level
`QA` worker-job handler.

### Trial Storage Layout

New trial artifacts use ``tasks/<task_id>/trials/<namespace>/<trial_id>/`` when
``ODDISH_TRIAL_ARTIFACT_NAMESPACE`` is set. Hosted Modal apps set it to
``<secret-environment>-<app-name>`` so forked databases cannot overwrite another
deployment’s trial artifacts. Worker uploads, imports, copied trials, and scoped
write credentials share this prefix. Stored ``trial_s3_key`` pointers and legacy
read fallbacks stay unchanged. Self-hosted installations default to the historical
``tasks/<task_id>/trials/<trial_id>/`` layout. Every upload
uses an immutable retry prefix: ordinary agent and operator-probe attempts use
``attempt-<attempt>/``; QA, QA-eval, audit, and summarize attempts use
``analysis-<kind>/attempt-<attempt>/``. Harbor's randomly named trial directory
lives below that attempt prefix. ``trials.trial_s3_key`` stores the exact
attempt prefix returned by the uploader, so later retries never replace the
manifest or leave the row pointing at a mixed set of attempt directories.

The attempt root's Harbor ``result.json`` is the artifact manifest. The shared
trial-artifact resolver extracts ``trial_results[].trial_name``, sanitizes it
with the same storage-key encoding used during upload, and selects exactly one
``<trial_s3_key>/<trial_name>/`` directory. Trajectory, task instruction,
verifier output, agent-file, and structured/free-form log readers all use that
selected directory. If the
manifest is malformed or an exact artifact is absent, a reader returns no
artifact; it never substitutes a sibling retry directory. Deterministic
candidate/list fallback exists only for imported and historical shared-prefix
layouts that either lack a root manifest or carry Harbor 0.20's selectorless
root job summary. An `attempt-N` root with that selectorless summary is malformed
and fails closed. When ``trials.trial_s3_key`` is null, the canonical trial root
is eligible for historical fallback only if it contains no ``attempt-N`` or
``analysis-*/attempt-N`` namespace; once immutable attempts exist, the missing
pointer makes every sibling non-authoritative and artifact reads fail closed.
The file LISTING and file CONTENT endpoints both root at
``trials.trial_s3_key`` when set, so listed relative paths round-trip without
doubling an analysis or attempt segment. Analysis-result readers locate their
one result artifact by filename suffix within that authoritative attempt prefix.

The normal ATIF reader downloads the attempt manifest and selected
`agent/trajectory.json` without preliminary existence checks: two GETs on
a cache miss. `is_missing_object` in `db/storage.py` owns missing-object
classification for both readers and storage diagnostics: a known missing code,
or HTTP 404 with an absent/empty code, activates missing-file behavior. Explicit
non-404 statuses and bucket, permission, and service errors propagate. Finished
trajectories remain cached for 120 seconds in each process, keyed by trial, attempt, and
artifact prefix. Request traces expose `storage.trajectory_cache.hit`,
`storage_client_init.duration_ms`, and `trajectory_cache_wait.duration_ms`
alongside storage request counts and download timings.

Modal compute-cost ledger rows use full UUID hex identifiers (32 characters)
within the existing 64-character column; high-volume ledger inserts must not
truncate UUIDs to the eight-character IDs used by some other entities.

CUA / verifier LLM spend lives in `verifier_costs` (sibling of
`analysis_costs`), one row per `(trial_id, attempt, component)` for
`cua_loop` and `cua_judge`. It is **never** folded into `trials.cost_usd`
(solver only), the `analysis_spend` view, user quotas, or the people
leaderboard (`billed_user_id` stays null). Settlement reads local
`verifier/` artifacts after Harbor; cleanup backfills from S3 with
`cost_source=backfill`. Surfaces: trial/experiment/task tiles and the
admin type stack (`verifier` next to inference / QA / compute). Public
share pages omit it. Apply core migration `verifier_costs_001` before
deploying readers.

### Default Harbor dependency

The default Harbor pin includes Modal domain-filter initialization for restricted
startup policies and Claude retry-session preservation. Change
`oddish/src/oddish/harbor-pin.toml`, run `oddish/scripts/sync_harbor_pin.py`, and
regenerate both package lockfiles together. Validate the network fix on copied
staging tasks before production promotion; changing the pin affects worker images.

`OddishClaudeCode` records session IDs from successful command output because
the pinned Harbor records them only on errors. Multi-step Claude tasks with
`resume_trajectory=true` need that ID to continue after a successful step.
Keep the missing/conflicting-session rejection and provider-error retry behavior;
the same runner is inherited by probes. Cover successful continuation with
`oddish/tests/test_claude_code_agent.py` when updating Harbor or this runner.

### Worker resource comparison

The production workflow sets `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_CANDIDATE_MAX_CONTAINERS=20`;
staging and preview retain the default of two. This bounds both Modal containers
and dispatcher reservations. The database's live fraction and worker cap still
require an explicit control update after deployment; see the production 10% /
twenty-worker command in `docs/worker-resource-canary.md`.

`process_single_job_candidate` shares `_run_one_job` with the base worker. Its
initial reservation is `cpu=(0.6, 17)`, scalar `memory=3072`, non-preemptible,
with no warm containers and a default two-container maximum. Deployment controls are
`ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_CANDIDATE_CPU`, `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_CANDIDATE_MEMORY_MB`,
and `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_CANDIDATE_MAX_CONTAINERS`. The base remains 1 core /
3072 MiB. Deployment-owned secret values keep declared and recorded resources
identical when Modal imports the image.

Apply core migration `worker_resources_001` before this worker deploy. It seeds
`worker_resource_rollout` with fraction zero, max_workers two, and configuration
`candidate-cpu0.6-mem3072`. Change the row through `backend/worker_resource_rollout.py`
or SQL; it is read before every hosted claim, including batch continuations.
The candidate cohort is the first fraction of the 32-bit MD5 buckets of worker
job IDs, restricted to ordinary agent trials (not probes), non-positive priority,
default Harbor image, and default execution lane. Retries keep their bucket.
Base workers exclude the cohort only while the matching configuration is enabled;
standalone workers retain unscoped behavior. Organization authorization and the
existing fair-share planner still apply.

`queue_slots.resource_candidate` survives the first claim so pending and running
candidate workers share the cap across dispatcher processes. These are the same
model-capacity slots, not additional capacity. A candidate-only backlog at the cap
does not launch base workers. The candidate must own a candidate reservation to
claim. Setting fraction or max_workers to zero stops new candidate claims; the
short claim transaction takes a shared rollout-row lock, so the stop commits only
after in-flight claims complete. Running jobs finish normally. Configuration
changes also fence old candidates. Stop and drain before changing resource requests.

`worker_resource_attempts` records configuration, CPU request/limit, scalar memory,
non-preemptibility, and Modal invocation ID atomically with each hosted claim,
independently of best-effort cost recording. Join it to `modal_costs` on
`worker_job_id` and attempt for historical cost attribution. One invocation can
appear in several attempt records; do not put it in the cost ledger's unique
`external_id` column. See `docs/worker-resource-canary.md` for commands and evidence.

### Worker Runtime Invariants & Pitfalls

Load-bearing properties, several learned from incidents. Changing them naively
silently breaks throughput or correctness — read before touching
`worker/functions.py`, `slots.py`, `cleanup.py`, or the dispatcher.

1. **Workers hold NO DB connection during the Harbor run.** A trial runs for
   minutes to ~12h but only touches the DB for a few ms (claim, 30s heartbeats,
   outcome), so workers use `NullPool` (`Settings.db_use_null_pool`) + per-op
   `asyncpg` connections. ⚠️ Never introduce a pooled/long-lived connection or
   open session spanning the run: it pins one idle connection per running trial
   and exhausts the Supavisor/PgBouncer cap. (The API keeps a warm `QueuePool`
   only because it's short-lived — that reasoning doesn't transfer to workers.)
   Quota pause signals come from live cost checkpoints. The owning worker calls
   Harbor `Job.pause()` / `Job.resume()` without holding a database session. A
   paused trial's `trials.status` becomes `PAUSED`, while its owning
   `worker_jobs` row stays `RUNNING`; it retains its queue slot and keeps
   heartbeating. Running and paused jobs periodically open a short session so
   they react to spend reported by sibling trials and to quota changes.

2. **`queue_slots` is the real concurrency gate.** Hosted dispatch reserves
   these same rows before calling Modal (`reserve_queue_launches`). Pending
   reservations hold a unique `locked_by` token, a 300-second `locked_until`,
   and `launch_demand` containing the organization/model/variant/lane/priority
   class. Pending demand is subtracted from ready demand so the 30-second poll
   cannot repeatedly launch workers for the same waiting jobs. At worker start,
   `acquire_queue_slot(reservation_token=...)` atomically transfers the same row
   to the worker and marks `launch_demand.adopted`; the first job claim clears
   that demand in the same transaction as the claim, preventing duplicate
   demand in the adoption-to-claim gap. Stale or duplicate tokens fail closed.
   Failure releases only unadopted tokens. No Modal call runs inside
   the reservation transaction. Expiry restores capacity even if the launcher
   dies; the orphan reaper excludes pending launches until expiry.

   `queue_dispatch_state` serializes hosted planning and persists organization
   and class cursors. Organizations rotate; within each org, three launch turns
   prefer priority > 0 (QA, audit, QA-eval, summarize), then one prefers <= 0.
   An empty or capacity-blocked class lends its turn to the other. Workers keep
   their allocated org/class while draining and retain priority/user/FIFO claim
   ordering inside that scope. Ordinary launches therefore receive one in four
   turns under sustained eligible analysis demand, even across one-slot polls.
   This is allocation of newly available capacity, not preemption or capacity
   reserved exclusively for QA. Generic self-hosted workers keep unscoped claims.
   Model capacity remains shared across both classes and all variants/lanes.
   Per-model transaction advisory locks serialize free-slot reservation with
   legacy acquisitions; held leases above a newly lowered limit still count.

3. **Slot leases can outlive their worker — reclaim per-slot.** The lease
   (`locked_until`) is `WORKER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS + 30` (~12h); a SIGKILLed /
   preempted worker never runs its `finally` release. `cleanup_orphaned_queue_state`
   frees a slot whenever its `locked_by` has no `RUNNING` `worker_jobs` row on
   `current_worker_id` (with a `locked_at` grace, `ORPHANED_SLOT_GRACE_MINUTES`
   = 2, for the acquire→claim gap). ⚠️ Never gate this per-queue_key (e.g.
   "release only if zero jobs RUNNING on the key") — that was the original bug:
   one live job pinned every leaked lease for ~12h and starved the queue. The
   link is always `queue_slots.locked_by == worker_jobs.current_worker_id`.
   The limit used for both spawn planning and slot acquisition comes from
   `model_concurrency_overrides` when an admin override exists, otherwise from
   the deploy-time `ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES` / default settings.
   Dynamic advice never exceeds an admin override, and an override-read failure
   fails closed at zero rather than risking reopening a disabled queue.

4. **One model ⇒ one queue_key.** Limits key off the full `queue_key`; the same
   model under two keys gets the *sum* of both buckets against one provider quota
   (→ 429s, split dashboards, starvation). Canonicalize at enqueue in
   `oddish.config` (`normalize_trial_model` / `get_queue_key_for_trial` /
   `normalize_queue_key`): nop/oracle + variants collapse to the single
   `nop_oracle` id (`is_nop_oracle_agent`); z.ai / MiniMax / Moonshot / xAI map
   to `<provider>/<id>`. ⚠️ Known gap: Gemini isn't canonicalized — a bare
   `gemini-…` becomes `google/…` while `gemini/…` stays `gemini/…`, splitting one
   model across two buckets.

5. **No provider-level concurrency cap.** Each Bedrock/Gemini/Vertex model id is its own
   bucket, but they share one AWS/Google account quota — the sum of per-model
   limits can exceed account RPM/TPM with no global throttle (a source of 429s).

6. **Stale-heartbeat reap can double-run a trial.** If heartbeats stall for
   `STALE_HEARTBEAT_MINUTES` (15, e.g. a pooler blip), the reaper flips the live
   trial to `RETRYING` and another worker may run it concurrently — no fencing
   token. The window is a deliberate trade-off (raised from 10 after an incident);
   shrink with care.

7. **A stable-variant harbor pin is REWRITTEN at claim time.** A trial's
   `harbor_config.resolved_sha`/`source` (and the indexed `trials.harbor_sha`
   projection) are stamped at submission, but the deployment is the unit of
   harbor identity for a stable variant (`variant_id == "gke"`): a trial
   queued across a pin bump executes whatever the deployment now ships. The
   claim path (`_refresh_stable_variant_pin`, trial_handler) rewrites the
   recorded pin to what the claiming runtime EXECUTES -- read from the
   imported harbor's PEP 610 installation metadata, so a Modal variant
   image stamps its blessed pin, the default image stamps the locked
   default, and self-host or local workers stamp whatever is installed --
   logging one supersession warning. Consequence for readers: pin filters and
   audit queries over `harbor_sha` see the EXECUTING revision for stable
   variants (the `gke` blessed pin, or the locked default pin for every
   non-registered variant), never a stale submission-time value. `ephemeral`
   exact-pin trials keep their submission pin verbatim -- they run it
   out-of-process against the recorded source/SHA -- and the projection is
   reconciled at claim for every harbor-running trial, healing retry/
   combine/import copies persisted without it. Local (self-host) mode
   routes through the same refresh and needs no override: the metadata of
   the harbor it imports is what it executes.

### Local Development

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run modal serve deploy.py
```

### Hosted organization approval

All authenticated hosted routes check `organizations.execution_enabled` through
`backend/org_access.py`, including cached API keys. This check returns the fresh
organization row (without loading relationships), and `require_auth` supplies it
on `auth.org` on both cache hits and misses. Keep ORM rows out of identity caches.
`authorized_read_session(request, auth)` owns the same checks for read routes:
resolve identity before entering, then check analysis-key resource restrictions
and current organization approval on the borrowed read session. Trial detail,
task open/panel/detail/files, delivery-board and QA-history reads reuse that
session for their resource queries. Trial artifact GETs (files, logs, result,
trajectory, and probe/debug artifacts) also share this scope, detaching the trial
before calling storage. End the scope before storage downloads or
streaming; never hold a database connection across artifact I/O. Other routes
keep `require_auth`, which uses the same checks but releases the session before
returning. Workers can still call `require_execution_org` without a session.
The shared Modal image must copy `org_access` through `add_local_python_source`
in `backend/modal_app.py`: API and worker startup both import it, and `uv_sync`
installs dependencies without installing the backend project itself.
Clerk org creation and membership never grant approval. Missing active-org claims must return 403, not
create a Personal org or infer membership by email. Both Clerk webhook and login
provisioning use `sync_clerk_org` to serialize organization/slug writes and preserve
revocation. Login and membership callbacks share one user update path that
replaces placeholder emails when a real address arrives and preserves existing
email when the payload omits it. Clerk v2 token organization claims are normalized
after verification.

Hosted dispatch filters unapproved orgs, and both worker lanes inject an approval
callback into the core runner before execution and every 15 seconds. Keep that
policy in backend; self-hosted core runners default to no callback. The reconciler
and operator revoke command use the existing task cancellation/remote teardown
path. Cleanup builds candidate task IDs from active trials and task/trial jobs
before looking up tasks; do not restore per-task correlated job-history scans.
Worker-job diagnostics compare the native status enum so PostgreSQL can use
status indexes. The GitHub identity backfill preserves users on Clerk HTTP
errors. An entirely failed batch of at least 10 users backs off for 15 minutes
in the warm reconciler process (a restart resets the cooldown); failed/deferred
lookups remain visible in the reconciler heartbeat rather than reporting health.
Cleanup heartbeat errors include the exception class, including bare timeouts.
See `backend/README.md` for initial migration IDs, deployment order, operator
approval commands, and the separate live Clerk organization settings.

### Configuration (backend)

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Minimum required: `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL` and `CLERK_DOMAIN`. Add
`CLERK_SECRET_KEY` for Clerk-backed org management and `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
for webhook ingestion. Common optional settings include `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
(plus `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEX` for Vercel preview origins when the dashboard
calls the API directly),

`CLERK_ISSUER`, `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`, the `ODDISH_S3_*` set, provider keys
(`AZURE_OPENAI_*`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, …),
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `ODDISH_DASHBOARD_URL`. See `backend/.env.example` for the
full surface and `backend/README.md` for details.

Slack link unfurls are a lean hosted-only integration configured through
`ODDISH_SLACK_UNFURL_*`. One manually installed Slack workspace is bound to one
Oddish org; the Slack app needs `links:read` and `links:write`, subscribes to
`link_shared`, and sends signed events to `POST /webhooks/slack/events`.
Optional team and channel allowlists provide defense in depth. This integration
is separate from the scheduled expense-notification webhook.

Modal `api_app` is placed in `us-east`, near the hosted PostgreSQL database;
override `ODDISH_MODAL_API_REGION` in the deploying process for another database
region. Workers and the QA-model gateway keep their existing placement.
Hosted API containers keep a conservative warm SQLAlchemy pool by default so
Modal bursts do not overrun shared Postgres poolers. The engine still disables
prepared statement caching so it remains compatible with transaction-mode
poolers such as Supavisor / PgBouncer. Two request-path caches are tunable:
`ODDISH_AUTH_IDENTITY_TTL_SECONDS` (Clerk identity entries in the auth cache,
default 900; API-key entries stay at 60 s) and
`ODDISH_COST_EXCLUSIONS_CACHE_SECONDS` (default 60, `0` disables). Every span
also carries `oddish.modal_region` / `oddish.modal_cloud` from the container's
`MODAL_REGION` / `MODAL_CLOUD_PROVIDER`, so per-region database round trips
are a Logfire query rather than a probe.


Modal runtime knobs (scaling, schedules, CPU/memory, concurrency) are read
directly by `backend/modal_app.py` from `ODDISH_MODAL_*` /
`ODDISH_DEFAULT_MODEL_CONCURRENCY` / `ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES` /
`ODDISH_ENABLE_SLACK_EXPENSE_NOTIFICATIONS` / `MODAL_APP_NAME` /
`MODAL_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT` env vars. `modal_app.py` is the
source of truth for the full list and defaults (e.g.
`ODDISH_MODAL_MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL=256`,
`ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_MAX_CONTAINERS=2688`).

Preview deployment parses the unique `-api.modal.run` URL from Modal's output
with `.github/scripts/preview/extract_modal_api_url.py`. The QA-model gateway's
`-api-qa-model.modal.run` URL is a separate endpoint and must never become the
frontend's backend URL. Missing or ambiguous API URLs fail deployment validation.

Preview deployment jobs in `.github/workflows/pr-preview.yml` stop when a newer
push cancels the run. If cancellation interrupts database preparation or the
replacement backend deploy, change detection forces backend recovery on the next
push; an older successful deployment is not proof that the app still runs.
Successful preparation followed by a skipped backend job permits reuse of an
older backend only when the whole workflow succeeded. A cancelled, failed, or
unfinished workflow instead forces recovery, since the skip may follow an app stop.
If preparation itself was interrupted and no newer preparation succeeded, the
next push reruns database preparation even when no migration files changed.
Database preparation retains the private CI tools image. Backend deployment uses
Python 3.13 and uv's dependency cache on the runner; Vercel uses a cached, pinned
CLI without downloading the Python/database image. Frontend and backend deploys
run concurrently after database preparation, and the required preview gate waits
for both. A Vercel deployment is reused only for the requested commit when its
resolved build and runtime environment snapshots match all preview settings.

The Modal image installs locked third-party dependencies before copying Oddish
source or applying deployment-specific environment variables. Its base uses
Python 3.13, matching the project requirement. `UV_LINK_MODE=copy` is set before
all uv installs, separately from the later deployment-specific environment.
Harbor variant dependencies are installed before source; the later editable
Oddish install uses `--no-deps` so it cannot replace that variant.
Preview seeding restores cyclic task/trial references
in bounded SQL batches and logs table-load/reference timings. Sampling coverage,
schema trust fingerprints, preview-owned credentials, and zero warm preview
containers retain their existing behavior.

PR preview deploys and manual preview resets set
`ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_MAX_CONTAINERS=400`, allowing each worker function up to
400 concurrent Modal containers for Archil testing.
`ODDISH_MODAL_MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL=400` lets the dispatcher launch up to 400
workers in one pass. Previews also set
`ODDISH_DEFAULT_MODEL_CONCURRENCY=400` and
`ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES={}` so the inherited 256-trial model
limits do not prevent one model from filling that pool. Saved admin overrides
still take precedence. Worker/container limits and model queue limits are
baked into the image and appended as the final runtime secret so older provider
secrets cannot replace the deployment values during container import. These
workers also launch and monitor Archil sandboxes; sandbox-provider capacity and Modal workspace quotas still
apply independently.

### GKE Placement Contract

The pinned Harbor (harbor-gke `6ec8e946`+) requires explicit placement for
every GKE TPU trial — there is no default provisioning mode, no table-derived
zone pool, and `accelerator_region_prefixes` is inert. A trial missing any
required field fails at environment construction with an error naming the
field and the served zones; it does not sit in a scheduling wait.

Required fields and where they come from:

- **`provisioning_mode`** (`on-demand` | `spot` | `flex-start`) — from the
  task's `[environment.kwargs]` or a per-submission
  `--environment-kwarg provisioning_mode=...`. A deployment MAY force a
  fleet-wide mode by setting `ODDISH_GKE_PROVISIONING_MODE`; the backend
  ships it only when configured (unset means "not configured", and each
  task/submission states its own). Deployment-shipped kwargs override the
  task's in Harbor's merge — a deployment that forces a mode overrides every
  task's choice, which is why previews deliberately leave it unset.
- **`[environment.tpu] zones`** — from the task only. Validated against the
  mode's served-zone table, scoped to the region. A single-zone pool is
  pinned through the node selector; multi-zone pools use affinity.
- **`region`** — from deployment coordinates (`ODDISH_GKE_REGION`) or a
  per-submission kwarg override.

Migration: GKE tasks written before this contract (no mode, no zones) stop
scheduling and fail with the requiredness error until updated.

### Preview organization approval

`backend/preview_org_approvals.py` owns copying production operator decisions
into previews. `prepare_preview_database.sh` invokes it after migrations,
seeding, and preserved-row restoration on every preparation, including reused
branches, overlapping credential publication and awaiting both before deploy.
It adds approved organization identities absent from the task sample,
matches by Clerk ID (original database ID for legacy Personal organizations),
revokes unknown/denied identities, and validates expected access in one
transaction. Production's approval column must exist first. Abundant,
SRE-World, and CyberMasters are required successful-access fixtures; their IDs
are assertions about production approval, never an approval grant.

Both paths in `preview_seed.py` must exclude `execution_enabled` from inserts
and updates, allowing the column default on new rows. Budgets and credentials
are not copied by approval sync. Keep the final sync outside migration/seed
conditionals, and keep fleet maintenance out of per-PR CI. Revocation reaches
existing previews only when their next preparation or operator sync runs.

### Preview Branch Preserved Rows

`preview_seed.py` samples `task_delivery_history` for sampled tasks together with
its source records, import receipts, and mapped customers. It reconciles imported
task membership but retains source evidence and customers, which preview-owned
work may reference. `find_last_deploys.migrations_matches` includes seed-loader
changes so reused branches receive changed sample coverage without a schema reset.

After migrations, sample updates, and preserved-row restoration,
`prepare_preview_database.sh` runs `refresh_browse_summaries.py` on both new and
reused previews. Raw seed inserts bypass the trial-write hooks, so
`backend.preview_seed.refresh_browse_summaries` recalculates stored browse and
per-model statistics from the preview's own trials using the core refresh
function, in transactions of 200 task versions. Both metric refreshers acquire
their sorted per-version advisory locks in one SQL statement per batch, retaining
the same transaction lifetime and lock keys without per-version round trips.
Production aggregate totals
must not be copied: production contains trials outside the preview sample.
This also repairs existing previews; browse requests retain their stored-summary
read path. Summary repair overlaps approval sync and secret publication, and
all three must succeed before deployment.

Each preview branch database holds a schema named `preview_preserved` with one
table, `rows`. It keeps the API keys that a person creates from that preview
dashboard, and the `organizations` and `users` rows those keys need.

**Why it exists.** A preview rebuild runs `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE` and
restores a schema-only snapshot of production, which holds no rows. Without
this stash, every rebuild removes the keys.

**Why it sits outside `public`.** The rebuild drops `public` and nothing else,
so the stash survives. It also holds the rows in the database rather than in
the workflow process: the preview workflow uses `cancel-in-progress`, so a
second push can stop a run between the drop and the write-back.

**Lifecycle.** `bootstrap_preview_db.py` writes to the stash before the drop
and reads from it after `upgrade head`. The stash is not cleared after a
successful write-back, so a cancelled run stays recoverable. Rows are jsonb,
and `jsonb_populate_record` maps each one onto the current row type.

**Do not copy it between environments.** An API key is a credential for one
environment only. The seed must never sample `api_keys` from production or
from another branch; `_NEVER_SAMPLED_TABLES` in `backend/preview_seed.py`
enforces that, and `_assert_no_forbidden_tables` fails the seed if a later
change breaks the rule. Cloning a preview branch, or copying this schema
between branches, would put one environment's credentials in another.

**Do not delete it while diagnosing a branch.** It looks unused, and removing
it destroys the keys of everyone using that preview. A branch that is deleted
and made again loses the stash with the rest of the database; that is expected,
and a new key is then required.

### Database Migrations

The Thunder integration joins staging at core migration `merge_thunder_staging_001`.
Apply it before deploying the combined worker code; it preserves both the existing
Thunder fallback history and staging's worker-resource/finding migrations.

Two migration stacks are required:

```bash
# Core tables (run in oddish/)
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Cloud tables/extensions (run in backend/)
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

In hosted environments both stacks run in that order *before* the code deploy,
because the backend can hard-require new schema on its hot paths.
`.github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml` sequences migrations then the Modal
deploy; `modal-deploy.yml` (production) additionally orders the Vercel frontend
after the backend, so a new frontend never reaches an old backend.

Staging allows 400 worker containers and up to 400 starts per dispatcher poll.
Its `STAGING_DATABASE_URL` GitHub secret remains a session-pool connection on
port 5432 for migrations and bootstrap. Both staging workflows use
`.github/scripts/staging/publish_runtime_db.py` to publish the same credentials
on transaction-pool port 6543 to the `oddish-staging-db` Modal runtime secret.
The runtime must not use session mode: its 20-connection pool rejected worker
starts during the September 9 load test. Transaction pooling shares database
backends across brief API and worker transactions; the 400-worker setting is
an execution cap, not a claim of 400 simultaneous database transactions.

Every hosted HTTP response carries a fixed backend `Server-Timing` phase set:
`auth_verify`, `auth_cache`, `auth_total`, `db_checkout`, `db_sql`,
`external_http`, `db_commit`, `handler_db`, `handler_total`, and
`backend_total`. Missing work is represented as zero rather than omitting the
phase, so cold, warm, and concurrent traces are comparable. The
`backend.request.phases` span records per-request SQL counts and transmitted
response-body bytes. `backend_total` and `handler_total` stop at response start
because they ship in the response headers; the trace-only
`backend_complete.duration_ms` observation ends after the final ASGI body chunk
and includes streaming time, but not response background tasks. Production
entrypoints must use `create_asgi_app()` so timing wraps FastAPI's complete
middleware stack, including unhandled-error and capacity responses. Hosted and
core code must use `RequestTimedAsyncClient` for outbound HTTPX calls so the
request-wide `external_http` phase cannot depend on route-local wrappers. Never
attach response bodies, request payloads, credentials, or SQL parameter values.

## `frontend/` — Next.js Dashboard

Delivery create/add requests accept up to 5,000 task IDs or names, matching the
browser selection limit. Each request validates the entire set and inserts its
memberships in one transaction; a missing task rolls back the whole request.
Clients can still send smaller batches. The task picker sends its selection in
one request. Membership lookup returns existing requested IDs and maximum sort
order in one aggregate query; inserts remain SQLAlchemy batches. Browse count
requests skip pin-author resolution, and identical author/pin-author values
share one attribution lookup.

Task browse exposes `qa_outcome` and accepts `qa_outcomes` (CSV in the hosted
route; a sequence in core). Accepted/rejected require a completed verdict for
`current_version_id`, reusing `VERDICT_VERSION_SQL`; an older verdict is outdated.
This projection does not claim delivery evidence/sign-off readiness. It adds no
SQL round trip. `exclude_delivery_id` excludes live memberships within the
request's organization for page, count, and ID selection. The task proxy maps
its `delivery` context to that predicate; saved filters never persist the
context, and applying them preserves the current destination.

Task and experiment drawers share the `experiment.trial-drawer` layout saved
through `GET/PUT /users/me/ui-layouts/{layout_key}` (same `/api/` proxy path).
The hosted `user_ui_layouts` table keys versioned JSON by authenticated
organization-membership user ID and layout key. Only Clerk user sessions may
access it. Apply backend migration `user_ui_layouts_001` before deployment.
`use-user-ui-layout.ts` owns an account-specific store; it loads once per mounted
page, merges gestures made while loading, and serializes coalesced writes.
Only gestures save: viewport clamping and restoration never write a preference.
The preferred expanded width survives maximizing; hidden panes preserve the
last noncollapsed split. Public pages use local state without preference API
requests. The old browser-global keys are not imported because they have no
account ownership. A read failure leaves the drawer usable and exposes Retry;
it must not overwrite an unread server preference with defaults.

The frontend is a Next.js 16 / React 19 App Router app. Browser code calls
`src/app/api/*` route handlers, which forward to the backend from
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and preserve auth. Public routes are `/`, `/share/*`,
`/datasets/*`, `/api/public/*`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/api/client-traces`,
and — deliberately, for link-unfurl bots — `/experiments/*` plus
`/orgs/{orgSlug}/experiments/*`; everything else is Clerk-protected.
Authenticated app pages live under `/orgs/{orgSlug}/…` (for example
`/orgs/acme/tasks`). Unprefixed `/tasks` and the short-lived
`/{orgSlug}/tasks` shape redirect when signed in. `/share/*` and `/datasets/*`
stay unprefixed. Selecting another organization opens its dashboard with no
query string or fragment, so resource IDs from the previous organization are
not carried into the destination workspace. `OrgSlugSync` uses the same
dashboard destination when the active organization changes before navigation
finishes, rather than restoring the previous resource URL.

Authenticated proxy routes forward incoming `traceparent`, `tracestate`, and
`baggage` headers to the backend and join the backend's `Server-Timing` value
onto the Next response on success, upstream error, and streamed passthrough
responses. Keep this behavior in `frontend/src/lib/proxy-headers.ts`; the
generic JSON proxy requires its incoming request, and bespoke hot routes must
use the same helpers instead of replacing an existing timing value.

The shared authenticated proxy adds `next_auth`, `next_token`, `next_upstream`,
`next_json` (buffered responses only), and `next_total` durations alongside
backend timing, including errors. Task open/detail/panel use its streaming
option. Streaming totals end at response construction, not the last body byte.

**Direct API mode** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_DIRECT=1`, off by default) lets the
browser call the backend itself instead of going through those `/api/*`
handlers: one fewer hop (Vercel edge, Vercel function, then Modal) and one
trace instead of two. `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` owns the mapping: every
dashboard request keeps its `/api/...` string as its SWR key and as the URL
it would send to the proxy; `resolveApiUrl` turns that into
`${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/...` (identity for every proxy except the five
`settings/*` and `admin/users/{id}/costs` rewrites listed there), `apiFetch`
attaches the token minted by the Clerk client with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE` (the same template the proxies use
server-side), and `/api/public/*` reads go without a token. Experiment IDs lose
the extra URL-encoding layer normally consumed by Next's route parser. Three proxy groups stay
in the path because they do real work -- the Logfire relay
(`/api/client-traces`), the zip import, and task browse (which translates the
address-bar search/tag/date filters) -- and a request that cannot get a
token yet (Clerk still loading) or runs during server rendering also keeps
the proxy for that call. The backend side is `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEX`
(preview origins are unpredictable) and `backend/api/cache_headers.py`, which
sets the `Cache-Control` values the proxies used to add, keyed on the matched
route template; private responses also vary by `Authorization` so switching
organizations cannot reuse another token's cached response. Each PR backend
permits its own `https://pr-{number}.oddish.app` frontend origin. The combined
`perf/request-path-combined` branch opts its Vercel preview into direct mode
in `frontend/next.config.ts`; an explicit flag overrides this, and other
deployments remain off by default. The public token-template name defaults to
the existing server-side `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE` at build time.
New mutation call sites must use `apiFetch`, never a bare
`fetch("/api/...")`. The proxy files stay until direct mode has run in
production for a while; delete them only in a dedicated change.


The trial drawer surfaces verifier test counts only as a small passed/total
row in the Summary tab (shown on public share views too); trials without test
counts show no row. Persisted `_verifier` CTRF counts are the sole source.
Historical trials without that summary show no count; opening a trial must not
list or read its artifacts to reconstruct one.

Experiment task rows give the name its own wrapping line, with verdict,
findings link, version, and cost underneath. Member experiment task pages
include nullable `must_fix_count`, computed from the current version's completed
source audit; unknown or unfinished audits stay null. Public pages do not expose
that count. Do not parse the rejection explanation to infer a finding count.

On an experiment page, removing a task always calls the scoped
`DELETE /experiments/{experiment_id}/tasks/{task_id}` proxy. It unlinks that
experiment membership and its scoped trials without deleting the task, even
when it was the task's final experiment membership. Whole-task deletion remains
a separate explicit action outside the experiment-scoped table.

The experiment drawer canonicalizes task/trial deep links with native browser
history updates, without triggering a route navigation. Opening a visible task
pane starts its file listing even while Overview is selected; switching between
Overview and Files preserves the listing request, selection, and expanded
folders. Keep the task navigation and overview mounted while the listing loads.
Hidden task panes still defer their file requests.

The `deliveries/loading.tsx` route boundary streams a placeholder while the
delivery list or detail server page awaits its initial data. The loaded board
still seeds the matching browser query without an immediate duplicate fetch.
Delivery board view state lives in URL parameters: `page` (one-based),
`per_page` (10, 25, 50, or 100 rows; defaults to 25),
`filter`, `issue`, `owner`, `group`, and
`task` (expanded task ID; legacy task names remain supported). The browser
reads these directly with `useSearchParams`; native history updates preserve
Back/Forward behavior. The initial server read and browser cache use the same
normalized data parameters; disclosure and unrelated link parameters do not
change the page request.
Filter/group changes reset the page and task focus. Bulk selections and draft
edits remain local. The delivery page passes its server-loaded board with the
Clerk user/org IDs and fetch time to a page-owned SWR cache. The cache is keyed
by user, organization, delivery, and normalized page/filter/group/focus parameters. A matching
server result suppresses the immediate browser board read; missing/mismatched
results fetch normally, and non-frozen snapshots at least 15 seconds old refresh
on activation. The board and expanded history share this cache and its mutate
functions. Experiment metadata uses the route ID without a backend request;
the active browser page updates its tab title from the already-loaded experiment
name. The board owns the existing 15-second SWR refresh: each
successful read also revalidates the expanded task's details and QA history, including
reads after page mutations. History has no separate timer. Refresh errors
retain loaded data with a stale warning and adjacent retry; revalidation never
clears cached data or starts analysis. Frozen delivery boards disable periodic
refreshes and label separately fetched history as live task history rather than
the shipped snapshot.
`GET /deliveries/{id}/view` returns only the requested page of rows, plus
whole-delivery totals, owner-scoped state counts, owner names, and compact ID
lists for inventory and matching selection. State and issue filters narrow the
queue, not owner summary counts. The expanded task alone receives full finding
bodies; other rows retain finding identity and acknowledgment metadata. Core
approval checks still evaluate all required facts with the same calculator;
readiness is not cached or persisted. Grouping uses case-insensitive server label
order, with stable membership order for ties. Missing/deleted members remain
blockers. A task link resolves by ID before legacy name and stays visible outside
filters. Finalized pages are slices of the stored snapshot, never live recomputes.

`GET /deliveries/{id}/selection` resolves every matching task to its ID and viewed
version when Select all is used; it never silently selects only the visible page.
Sign-off confirms those versions and rejects stale writes. Single-task sign-off
loads only that task's evidence; finalization and progress recording continue
calculating the entire delivery. The original complete-board endpoint remains
available to CLI and standalone callers. Hosted reads share approval and data
access in one read session, checking approval on every request.

Visible-row expansion reuses an equivalent loaded page cache entry and derives
focus immediately from the URL. `GET /deliveries/{id}/tasks/{task_id}` supplies
only that member's full evidence; it preserves hosted approval and frozen
snapshot semantics. Detail and history requests start independently. The table
owns checks and acknowledgments; details hydrate only matching finding identities
on the same task/member/version. Missing or changed details disable mutations
and expose retry or refresh. Off-page links and out-of-filter exceptions still
resolve through the page endpoint. The whole-delivery calculation on page reads
and the 15-second poll remain until the separate persisted-summary change.

Writes invalidate cached pages and refresh the mounted view; late responses
cannot restore pre-write data. Cached navigation keeps the previous page visible
while the new request finishes and marks that transition. History prefetch starts
after 150 ms of hover/focus, allows at most two active prefetches, and shares its
pending request with an opened history panel. See `docs/delivery-board-pages.md`.

Review presentation distinguishes task defects, execution classifications,
review progress, and version-specific human sign-off. Shared review words live
in `frontend/src/lib/review.ts` and `frontend/src/lib/deliveries.ts`; a failed
review does not establish a task defect, and favorable automation does not sign
off a delivery. `pre_trial_passed` means the source review completed; the
existing verdict and must-fix checks still decide whether defects block delivery.
Do not change severity policy as part of presentation changes.

Task panel responses populate the existing version `experiments` list with
source experiment names for that version's non-deleted, non-superseded trials,
restricted to the authorized organization. The overview uses those names for
the linked groups under Other experiments. This stays within the panel's two
SQL statements. Delivery check `detail` includes stored failed-audit and failed-QA
reasons; run coverage includes both configured thresholds. The short
`failure_labels` remain status labels, ordered QA verdict, pre-trial audit, runs
in the UI. Acknowledgement undo uses the existing version-checked `checked: false`
request for both `ack:` findings and `waive:` check exceptions.

Task open/panel and experiment task rows carry `review_version_matches`, derived
from the saved verdict's QA trial and the displayed version. An older verdict
must remain distinguishable from a review of the selected version. The shared
bounded provenance query does not fetch trial artifacts or enqueue work.
Experiment summary selections use `verdict=accepted|rejected|running|failed|unreviewed`;
review counts and filters both classify the loaded task rows with
`taskReviewFilter` (grouping `taskReviewStatus`), including live analysis and QA
trials. Drawer navigation retains the selected review group. Unreviewed includes
missing and outdated reviews, and remains visible when every task is unreviewed.
Delivery `filter` defaults to `all`; the State selector filters the task queue using
`needs_work`, `qa_incomplete`, `awaiting_signoff`, and `ready`. A `task` link resolves against the inventory (ID before legacy name)
and keeps that row visible across filters, pagination, and sign-off refreshes.
Expanded delivery tasks show unresolved findings and failed checks first;
acknowledged findings and waived checks share a collapsed record. Individual
findings replace the duplicate `no_must_fix` explanation when findings exist.
The board derives delivery blockers independently of review status and recorded
sign-off. Passed checks and history use native disclosures;
history remains mounted so board refreshes preserve its open versions.
Individual acknowledgment buttons show Saving while the check request runs,
then Updating until the delivery read finishes. The global busy state ends at
save completion; pending status is tracked per check so unrelated actions do not
wait for a slow refresh. Check refreshes mark all delivery page cache entries
stale without revalidation, then call SWR `mutate(pageKeyFilter)` with no data
argument. That promise waits for the mounted view's revalidation; passing
`undefined` as mutation data starts revalidation without waiting for it.
Delivery lookups join their customer, and task checks read membership and lock
the default-version pointer in one query. An acknowledgment uses six core SQL
statements (including the write), independent of whether the tick already exists;
hosted authorization and subsequent delivery/history reads add their own queries.

Finding links pin `version`, `finding`, `taskPane`, `taskFile`, and `taskLines`
on `/tasks/{id}`. Overview preserves the file and line address for sharing.
A missing explicit version, finding, or historical file must explain its
absence without substituting current content or removing that address. Switching
versions is browser history, including selecting today's default. Native history
updates pass `null` as state so Next updates `useSearchParams` itself; passing
Next's internal history marker bypasses that update.
Only an explicit version selection clears the previous line anchor; browser
Back/Forward restores the file and line address saved for the selected version.
The task pane derives its pane, file, and lines directly from the URL. The code
viewer ignores selection callbacks that echo its controlled selection prop.

Source and execution reruns reuse the existing task-panel handlers. Source
reruns target the default version, withdraw its published verdict, and can
automatically trigger execution review after import through
`maybe_start_task_qa_stage`. Execution reruns review recorded eligible runs and
synthesize a verdict; they do not rerun the solver. Reading pages or findings
and changing view filters must not call either operation.

See `frontend/README.md` for route groups, scripts, env vars, and deployment
commands. See `SELF_HOSTING.md` for full-stack local development and production
deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### API does not start

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.db setup
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Pulling from a remote API fails

- Verify `ODDISH_API_URL` and `ODDISH_API_KEY`.
- Try `oddish status` first to confirm auth and connectivity.

### Frontend "Failed to fetch" or disconnected backend

```bash
curl ${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:-http://localhost:8000}/openapi.json
```

### Clerk auth issues

- Verify Clerk keys in `frontend/.env.local`.
- If org-scoped backend access fails, confirm `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE` is set and includes `org_id`.
- If using production Clerk keys locally, use `frontend/run-prod-clerk-local.sh`.

### QA model request gateway

Opt-in `ODDISH_QA_MODEL_ROUTING_ENABLED` routes eligible platform-funded Sonnet 5
QA/audit/QA-eval Claude Code calls through the dedicated `qa_model_gateway` Modal
function (`backend/api/qa_model_app.py`), not the dashboard API's concurrency
budget. `ODDISH_QA_MODEL_GATEWAY_URL` must name that function's HTTPS origin.
`ODDISH_QA_MODEL_POOLS` declares verified independent account/model quotas and
secret env references. HDO keys sharing an organization are not extra pools.

`oddish.workers.queue.model_capacity` owns per-request admission at a projected
65% load, using short PostgreSQL transactions and expiring request reservations.
It never treats worker slots as API RPM and holds no DB connection during a
provider call. Preserve this separation from `queue_slots` and QA job priority.
`model_gateway` reuses worker-job token hashes for attempt-bound credentials;
analysis READ keys must never acquire gateway access. Feature-off stops new
routing while issued live attempt tokens continue working until revoked.
The gateway forwards Anthropic messages and translates Bedrock event streams;
never replay a partially streamed request or log provider keys/prompts.

See `docs/qa-model-routing.md` for configuration, accounting conservatism,
protocol scope, operator metrics, tests, and staging rollout prerequisites.

### Mandatory task-defect delivery policy

New source and execution findings use only `must_fix`; the shared
`analysis_check_payload`/`check_analysis_result` contract enforces this at
submission, verification, and import. `ActionTier` retains `optional` for historical reports. Apply core migration
`merge_finding_tiers_001` before deployment: it converts retired severity fields
to `must_fix` in audits, retained findings, analyses, and delivery snapshots.
Database triggers normalize older-worker writes to the same columns, so retired
severities cannot reappear. The migration commits each trigger before converting
history in 500-row primary-key batches, releasing table locks before the scans.
Lock waits are capped at five seconds; interrupted upgrades can be rerun. This
updates the existing revision for databases that have not applied it; databases
already at `merge_finding_tiers_001` need no further conversion.
The API no longer returns `pre_trial_should_fix`;
QA exports include converted findings in `must_fix_count`. Severity does not establish execution
causation: unrelated findings leave `GOOD_FAILURE` unchanged.

`oddish.core.task_findings` owns collection and retention. All recorded tiers
on a current task version require individual delivery acknowledgment, including
findings from superseded/deleted executions. Before clearing or replacing
review state, call `preserve_task_findings` under the existing mutation
transaction; it retains original evidence in `task_versions.reported_findings`.
Read paths never write this column or enqueue analysis. Newly published verdicts
reject established task defects; historical stored verdicts are not rewritten.
In-place source overwrite clears retained findings in the transaction replacing
the source bytes; re-analysis of unchanged source continues to retain them.

The `no_must_fix` check cannot be disabled or globally waived. Positive sign-off
and exception requests require the reviewed `expected_version_id` and the actor
from authentication. Delivery manual-check uniqueness includes version, and
history exposes each retained version decision. New versions inherit neither
findings nor decisions. Finalized delivery snapshots are never recomputed. The severity migration only
renames the retired category inside them; it preserves decisions and evidence.
Apply `task_defects_001` before deploying this code. See
`docs/delivery-design.md` for compatibility and forward-only migration policy.


Delivery overview and task rows use `deliveryTaskState` for one exclusive state:
open findings or a failed rejection/task-existence check need work; other failing
automated requirements mean QA incomplete; tasks with remaining human checks need
sign-off; ready requires the board's version-specific readiness. Recorded QA age
does not override delivery requirements, and approved exceptions can satisfy them.
The toolbar contains State, Owner, Category, and Group selectors. Summary counts
are read-only; the zero Needs sign-off count is omitted.
The owner selector scopes current counts, the task queue, and recorded progress;
state and category filters narrow only the queue. Finalize always uses the full
board's `ready`, including delivery-level checks. Grouping by owner or state omits
the corresponding repeated table column. Bulk sign-off lives in task selection.

The single step-line chart shows total and ready tasks. `progress_history` contains
at most 30 daily observations (latest per UTC day), with no extra browser request
or polling timer. New observations include `owners`, a map of user IDs (or
`unassigned`) to `{task_count, ready}` covering all tasks, including ready tasks.
It is stored inside the existing JSON counts column; no migration is needed.
A null/missing `owners` means owner history was not recorded, while an absent user
inside a recorded map means zero tasks. Never reconstruct past owners from today's
assignments. Missing dates stay gaps; no observations show "No history yet".
The history chart sits above the state counts. Even one observation renders in
the chart as labeled points; multiple observations form step lines with endpoint
counts and first/last date labels, without gridlines or a numbered vertical axis.
A single-day chart labels its date once. Isolated observations retain a dot across gaps.
`owner` accepts a user ID, `mine`, or `unassigned`. `panels` preserves disclosure
state as comma-separated panel IDs, with `!` for explicit collapse of a default-open
section; drafts, dialogs, and bulk selection stay local.

Apply core migration `delivery_progress_001` before deploying. The hosted
`record_delivery_history` function samples active deliveries hourly through the
existing Modal worker deployment; self-hosted operators can schedule
`python -m oddish.core.delivery_progress` hourly. Each delivery commits separately
under its delivery lock. The `(delivery_id, sample_hour)` primary key makes retries
replace the hour's observation. Errors log the affected delivery ID and do not
roll back other deliveries. Reads never record history. Finalization records the
last observation and freezes daily history in the shipping snapshot. Old finalized
snapshots remain unchanged. Progress history is stripped from customer-safe
snapshots because its counts include internal/hidden tasks. Acknowledged findings
are exceptions, not verified repairs; missing days have no observation, not zero.

Delivery legacy `filter=blocked` links include Needs work and QA incomplete,
excluding Needs sign-off and Ready. Verdict provenance on delivery boards and
task QA history orders by completion time (creation time when absent), then
creation time and trial ID descending to resolve ties consistently.

Delivery check responses include `failure_labels`, a list of concise unmet requirements derived from the configured check thresholds and the reviewed version. Passing, waived, and disabled checks contribute no row badges. The frontend uses these labels without parsing `detail`; older snapshots without the field use check-specific labels without invented counts. Delivery state keys and readiness rules are unchanged; the `qa_incomplete` grouping is displayed as "Checks needed", while task rows show the individual requirements even when grouped by state.

The task `/open` selected-version rollup includes `must_fix_count` and `pre_trial_must_fix_count`, computed in its identity query from retained, pre-trial, and eligible completed run-review findings. It does not include finding arrays or evidence bodies. Counts use each stored finding's own ID; live findings linked to an existing stored finding do not add another count. The frontend must read these scalar fields rather than assume `/panel` fields exist on `/open`.

### Reasoning effort in experiment comparisons

`TrialModel.reasoning_effort` reads the explicit value from
`harbor_config.agent_config.kwargs.reasoning_effort`, falling back to the older
`agent_overrides.kwargs` shape. The hybrid SQL expression projects only that
scalar into experiment results, pages, focus reads, and task summaries/previews;
these bounded reads must not return full Harbor configuration. Explicit JSON
null overrides the legacy value. Missing effort is unspecified, never inferred
from today's agent defaults. This derived field requires no database migration.

New submissions leave reasoning effort unset unless the caller supplies it.
Sweep matching and queue insertion preserve explicit kwargs, including null,
and environment overrides. Both launch forms start on Agent default and omit
reasoning effort for that choice. Explicit effort still separates experiment
columns and sweep counts. Historical configurations and retries keep their
saved settings; missing effort is never inferred from the agent's runtime default.

Private experiment views separate solver columns by agent, model, and effort by
default. Their Group effort levels toggle sets `groupEfforts=1` in the URL to
group across efforts. Public share views always group efforts, ignore the URL
grouping setting, and hide the toggle. The table, row filters, charts, and drawer navigation
use this grouping; trial settings and launch requests remain unchanged. Table cells, navigation, column visibility,
exports, and Pass/k share that identity. The model/effort label is display-only;
model-copy and submission keep the actual model identifier. Effort suffixes
inherit the model text's typography. Deterministic baselines and internal
QA/probe groups retain their separate grouping rules.

Sweep top-ups and failed-trial replacements match effort as well as agent/model.
The experiment Run trials dialog submits `add_trials: true` to create the
requested number of additional runs per task/configuration. It sends at most
four task requests concurrently, with one Idempotency-Key per task and user
submission. Failed requests retain their exact body/key for transport retries;
the hosted route always replays a completed add-trials key, even if those trials
subsequently failed. Existing declarative CLI top-ups retain their retry behavior.
The authenticated sweep proxy forwards Idempotency-Key. Reads and public pages
never launch runs; Run trials is available only after experiment results load.

The effort selector offers the bundled runners' choices for Codex (including
`max` on GPT-5), Gemini/Antigravity CLI, Cursor, Grok Build, mini-swe-agent,
Aider, OpenHands, Copilot CLI, DSH, and TBH. Gemini 3 Flash exposes
minimal/low/medium/high; Pro exposes low/high; Gemini 2.5 keeps effort unset.
Cursor model IDs that already contain `effort=...` keep the separate control
unset to avoid contradictory overrides. These are runner presets, not a live
provider capability catalog; a provider still validates its selected model.

Run effort UI regression tests with `pnpm exec playwright test -c
playwright.effort.config.ts` from `frontend/`. They use the production components
inside the isolated local test app and intercept submission requests. The effort
suite always starts this checkout’s server; set `EFFORT_TEST_PORT` when running
multiple worktrees (default `3117`). It refuses to reuse an occupied port. The
Dashboard CI workflow runs this config in a separate step and stores its
artifacts in `frontend/effort-test-results/`; the default dashboard config
excludes the local-only effort spec. Effort cases wait for the client-rendered
chart before interacting with server-rendered controls.

Finding attribution in a task overview opens trials through the host drawer,
including trials from other experiments. Source-file clicks select the file and
line range in the current task pane; they preserve the experiment route.

### Homebrew client distribution

`abundant-ai/homebrew-tap` builds a reviewed subset of the CLI and shared modules
from an immutable Oddish commit. Its client-files.txt owns the distribution list;
an import-closure check rejects dependencies on excluded Oddish modules. Keep
CLI imports independent of server and sandbox implementations. Client CPU/GPU
selection uses Daytona/Modal (Numinous when explicitly enabled); hosted APIs
validate the requested environment. Homebrew installs carry a HOMEBREW marker
in their distribution metadata so version/update commands never replace the
Homebrew-managed environment through PyPI.
