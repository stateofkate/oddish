# Oddish Frontend

## Overview

This is the Next.js App Router frontend for Oddish. It provides the authenticated dashboard, task browser, experiment views, public share and dataset pages, Clerk-based auth, and server-side API routes that proxy requests to the backend API.

Current app surface:

- `/` public landing page for signed-out users; signed-in users are redirected to `/orgs/{orgSlug}/dashboard`
- `/dashboard` main dashboard and experiment entrypoint
- `/tasks` authenticated task browser with search, pagination, per-task version summaries, and links back to experiments
- `/experiments` base page directing users to select an experiment
- `/experiments/[experiment]` experiment detail, task and trial inspection, logs, results, files, version history, share controls, per-task retry actions, and **cancel** for in-flight work (task drawer **Cancel (N)** or experiment table bulk **Cancel** when tasks are selected; both use `POST /tasks/cancel` with one or more task ids)
- `/qa` QA workspace; `/qa/skills` and `/qa/documents` provide organization
  skill and document-store management
- `/skills` and `/documents` compatibility routes that redirect into `/qa`
- `/usage` usage and cost reporting
- `/settings` organization management and API key management
- `/admin` includes an **Overview** with editable per-queue-key concurrency limits and queue health, plus detailed **Worker Jobs** and **Concurrency** tabs for job state and `queue_slots` leases
- `/share/[token]` read-only public experiment view
- `/datasets` and `/datasets/[token]` public dataset listing and detail pages

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Minimum setup:

```bash
# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Backend API URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Useful optional variables:

```bash
# Recommended for org-aware backend auth
CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=oddish

# Direct API mode: the browser calls NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL itself instead of the
# /api/* proxy routes (one fewer hop per request). Needs the same template
# name published to the browser and the app's origin allowed by the backend's
# CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS / CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEX. Off unless set to 1.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_DIRECT=1
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=oddish


# Optional Clerk route overrides
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard

# Optional absolute app URL, mainly useful for local HTTPS / production-like Clerk flows
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://local.oddish.app
```

### 3. Start the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev           # Next.js dev server
pnpm build         # Production build
pnpm start         # Run production server
pnpm lint          # ESLint
pnpm test          # Node unit tests in tests/*.test.ts
pnpm test:e2e      # Playwright end-to-end suite
pnpm typecheck:e2e # Type-check the Playwright project
pnpm format        # Prettier formatting
pnpm format:check  # Check Prettier formatting
```

## Architecture

The frontend uses server-side route handlers in `src/app/api/*` as the boundary between browser code and the backend. Browser components call internal Next.js routes, and those handlers resolve the real backend URL and forward auth headers when needed.

Request flow:

```text
Browser UI
  -> Next.js pages and client components
  -> Next.js route handlers in src/app/api/*
  -> backend API (FastAPI or Modal)
```

The backend URL is configured via a single `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` env variable in `src/lib/backend-config.ts`. Set it to `http://localhost:8000` for local development or to a deployed API URL for staging/production.

Browser requests are written as `/api/...` URLs and normally reach the backend through the Next.js route handlers under `src/app/api`, which mint the backend token server-side. With `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_DIRECT=1` the same requests go from the browser straight to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (`src/lib/api.ts` maps the path and attaches a token from the Clerk client); the SWR keys do not change. Use `apiFetch` from `src/lib/api.ts` for any new `/api/...` mutation so it takes part in that mapping.

Global client-side fetching defaults live in `src/app/providers.tsx`, which installs an `SWRConfig` with deduping and conservative revalidation settings for the entire app.

## Auth And Routing

The app uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for authentication and organization context.

Public routes:

- `/`
- `/sign-in/*`
- `/sign-up/*`
- `/share/*`
- `/datasets/*`
- `/experiments/*` at the middleware layer, so unfurl bots can read metadata;
  the authenticated app layout still redirects ordinary signed-out visitors
- `/api/client-traces/*`
- `/api/public/*`

Everything else is protected by Clerk middleware.

If you want backend JWTs to include org context, configure a Clerk JWT template and set `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`. Oddish expects claims like:

```json
{
  "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}",
  "org_id": "{{org.id}}",
  "org_role": "{{org.role}}"
}
```

## API Route Groups

The frontend proxies backend requests through `src/app/api/*`. Main groups:

- `/api/dashboard` for dashboard data
- `/api/tasks/*` for task browse/search, task detail, versions, trials, files, direct-to-S3 upload init/complete, `POST /api/tasks/cancel`, and task-level QA retry/cancel actions
- `/api/trials/*` for trial logs, structured logs, result payloads, retries, trajectories, and files
- `/api/experiments/*` for experiment detail, task listing, publish, unpublish, and share token creation
- `/api/settings/api-keys*` for API key management
- `/api/admin/*` for queue slots, queue status, orphaned state, and the unified `worker-jobs` matrix (`/api/admin/worker-jobs`)
- `/api/public/*` for public experiment, dataset, task-file, and trial artifact access

The experiment share dialog has a **Show QA** switch. It is off by default.
Publishing sends `show_qa` to the backend; **Save changes** updates the same
link. When QA is on, the share page shows read-only task checks and trial
reviews. The public task checks proxy is
`/api/public/experiments/[token]/tasks/[task_id]/qa`; it forwards the task
version and returns 404 when QA is off or the task is outside the share link.

```

## Development Workflows

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local` to point at the backend you want to use, then run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:8000` if not set. For backend setup and deployment instructions, see [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and [`backend/README.md`](../backend/README.md).

## Deployment

The hosted dashboard (oddish.app) deploys from `.github/workflows/modal-deploy.yml`,
which orders it after the database migrations and the Modal backend. `vercel.json`
disables Vercel's git deployments for `main` on purpose — the pipeline creates the
production deployment through the Vercel API once the backend is live. Re-enabling
git deployments for `main` (there or in the Vercel dashboard) restores the race
between a new frontend and the old backend.

`next.config.ts` enables `output: "standalone"`, and the checked-in `Dockerfile` builds a production container around the generated standalone server:

```bash
docker build -t oddish-frontend .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.local oddish-frontend
```

### Use Clerk production keys locally

If you need production-origin Clerk behavior locally:

1. Add a hosts entry:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 local.oddish.app" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

2. Set production Clerk keys plus app URL in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://local.oddish.app
```

3. Start the local HTTPS dev server:

```bash
./run-prod-clerk-local.sh
```

`next.config.ts` allows `local.oddish.app` as a dev origin for this workflow.

## UI Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui and Radix primitives
- SWR for client-side data fetching
- Clerk for auth
- Recharts for charts and graphs
- Shiki for syntax highlighting
- @tanstack/react-virtual for virtualized lists

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" or disconnected backend

Check that the backend is running and reachable at the configured URL:

```bash
curl ${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:-http://localhost:8000}/openapi.json
```

### Clerk auth issues

- Verify your Clerk keys in `.env.local`
- If org-scoped backend access is failing, confirm `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE` is set and includes `org_id`
- If using production Clerk keys locally, use `./run-prod-clerk-local.sh`

### CORS-like browser errors

The frontend is intended to call `src/app/api/*`, not the backend directly from browser code. If requests fail:

- verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local`
- make sure the request is going through the Next.js route handlers

### Task browsing and delivery selection

Tasks keeps the per-agent trial cards; Dashboard remains the experiment view.
The Tasks toolbar owns search, author, sort, and a single filter popover, with
removable active conditions. Numeric filters offer presets and validated custom
ranges. QA outcome refers to the verdict for the current task version, not the
success of the QA process; delivery readiness remains on the delivery board.

Delivery history appears first in Filters, with visible Sent to lab and Not sent
to lab selectors using mapped customers and unmapped imported labels. Cards and
delivery-picker rows share destination chips with batch/date details. No delivery
recorded means missing history, not proof that a task was never sent. The Tasks
page owns the search draft and debounce timer; both Clear filters buttons cancel
pending search writes and reset that draft while retaining the delivery and sort.

A delivery's Add tasks link opens `/tasks?delivery=<id>` with its customer history
filter. The same browser uses a comparison table with completion/failure/pending
counts and expandable trial cards. The destination stays in the URL through
filters, saved searches, and pagination. Page/count/ID requests exclude existing
members. Selections are stored separately per organization and delivery, and
only submitted IDs are removed after a successful add. Paste task IDs remains
available on the delivery board. Run these local flows with
`pnpm exec playwright test -c playwright.delivery.config.ts`.

Task browsing keeps QA, median steps and lab-history controls visible. Table/card
presentation and optional columns use URL parameters without refetching task data.
“Copy view link” shares current criteria; “Share selection” stores exact task IDs
through the saved-view API and opens `/tasks?selection_id=...`. These links retain
normal organization permissions and do not grant public access. Delivery picking
shows existing members as disabled selections and uses the same creation dialog
as the Deliveries page. Adding a task does not finalize or submit the batch.
