# Oddish Backend

Serverless API and worker orchestration for Oddish Cloud, deployed on [Modal](https://modal.com), with multi-tenant authentication and authorization.

## Overview

The backend wraps the OSS `oddish` core with:
- Multi-tenant API (`org_id`-scoped queries)
- Dual auth (API keys + Clerk JWTs)
- Modal-hosted API/workers/sandboxes, or Railway/Docker for standalone deployment
- Queue-key concurrency controls
- Public token-based sharing endpoints

## System Architecture

### Data flow

  └─ process_single_job
       - Acquires a queue_slots lease
       - Drains queued worker_jobs rows for its queue key until a

Harbor execution on Modal, Daytona, Archil, GKE (TPU), opt-in ephemeral EC2,
opt-in Numinous Cloud (CPU and optionally GPU), or opt-in Thunder GPU sandboxes
  - logs/artifacts persisted to S3
```

### Worker architecture

Dispatcher + batch-draining workers backed by the unified `worker_jobs` table:

1. `poll_queue()` runs on a 180s Modal schedule. It builds a dispatch plan via
   `build_dispatch_plan` (org-first fair share over active queue keys, plus a
   budgeted EC2 and Thunder capacity lanes) and launches up to
   `MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL`
   worker containers.
2. `reconcile_queue_state()` runs separately. It calls
   `cleanup_orphaned_queue_state` (zombie-txn reap, stale-heartbeat sweep,
   stage safety nets, orphaned-slot release) and runs the experiments owner
   backfill (dashboard Mine fast path).
3. `process_single_job(queue_key, ...)` acquires a `queue_slots` lease for
   the queue key, then on the default lane calls `drain_worker_jobs`, which
   atomically claims and runs queued rows one at a time until the
   `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_BATCH_BUDGET_SECONDS` budget (default 300) expires;
   the EC2 and Thunder lanes still run exactly one row via
   `run_single_worker_job`. Each
   claim dispatches to the registered handler
   (`TRIAL` / `TASK_EXPAND` / `TAG_PROJECT`), writes heartbeats to both
   `worker_jobs.heartbeat_at` and the mirrored domain column, records the
   outcome, runs the post-success hook, and releases the lease.

The only post-success hook is `notify_github_trial` on `TRIAL` rows
(`_POST_SUCCESS_HOOKS`); QA GitHub notifications fire separately through
`register_qa_imported_hook(notify_github_qa)` when a QA result is imported.
Handlers are registered at module load via
`ensure_builtin_handlers_registered()` so every container has `TRIAL`,
`TASK_EXPAND`, and `TAG_PROJECT` wired up before any claim. The legacy
`QA` / `ANALYSIS` / `VERDICT` / `QA_REVIEW` enum values are historical only —
QA, audit, and summary refreshes run as `qa`/`audit`/`summarize`-kind `TRIAL`
jobs. Adding a new kind is one handler class plus a `register` call — no new
claim SQL, cleanup step, or dispatcher branch.

## Authentication Model

The backend accepts auth from `Authorization`, `X-Clerk-Authorization`, or `X-Authorization`.

### API keys (programmatic access)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ok_abc123..." "$API_URL/tasks"
```

- Key format starts with `ok_`
- Stored hashed (SHA-256) in `api_keys`
- Scope options: `full`, `tasks`, `read`

### Clerk JWTs (dashboard access)

- Validated against Clerk JWKS
- Organization context extracted from token claims
- User and org membership resolved to internal auth context

### Auth flow

1. Read token from accepted header.
2. If token starts with `ok_`, validate API key and scope.
3. Otherwise validate Clerk JWT and resolve org/user.
4. Read the organization's `execution_enabled` approval from the database on
   every authenticated request, including cached identities and existing keys.
   Missing approval returns HTTP 403 before the route runs. This same read
   supplies current organization data to `/org` and invitation routes, so a
   cached identity never means missing or stale organization details.

Clerk tokens must select an organization (`org_id`, or `o.id` in v2 tokens).
Missing selection returns HTTP 403; it never creates a Personal organization or
chooses membership by email. If a selected organization has not arrived through
Clerk's webhook yet, the backend fetches it from Clerk and creates the local
record. A failed Clerk request returns HTTP 503 so the client can retry.
Membership callbacks read Clerk's `public_user_data.user_id` field and update
the same user record created by login. Supplied emails replace provisioning
placeholders; partial callbacks without an email preserve the stored address.
Organization synchronization serializes conflicting callbacks and preserves
approval and deletion state. Creation and membership events cannot grant access.

### Approving hosted organizations

`organizations.execution_enabled` defaults to false. Migration
`org_execution_001` approves only these active, non-deleted Clerk IDs:

| Workspace verified in Clerk | Clerk organization ID |
| --- | --- |
| Abundant (original workspace) | `org_39ufkEqie8rLlVhoK4YMm4IMx0L` |
| Abundant CyberMasters | `org_3H67wVrUZObfjW9JnxGq5pUZQvN` |
| Oddish-onsite | `org_3IVmVHXFyfF4ltX8bfQMQTHrH1y` |

Other existing organizations, Personal organizations, and future organizations
remain blocked. Names do not confer approval. Preview/dev Clerk IDs differ and
must be provisioned explicitly. Run the core migrations, then backend migrations,
before deploying the API and workers. Audit any additional legitimate workspaces
and provision their exact Clerk IDs before switching traffic.

An operator creates the organization and invitations in Clerk, then runs this
command from `backend/` with the intended deployment's `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL` and
matching `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`:

```bash
uv run python -m provision_org --clerk-org-id org_EXACT_ID --approve --monthly-limit-usd 100
uv run python -m provision_org --clerk-org-id org_EXACT_ID --revoke
```

The approval command synchronizes the organization and sets a positive monthly
budget in the same transaction as approval. Only someone with deployment database
access can grant approval; there is no tenant-admin approval endpoint. Budgets
retain the existing quota rules and administrator controls; approval is a separate
mandatory check, including when quota enforcement is disabled. This change does
not introduce a hard global spending ceiling for approved organizations.

Preview setup ends with `.github/scripts/preview/sync_org_approvals.py`, after
migrations, sample seeding, and restoration of preview-owned API keys. This
reads production approval decisions once and applies them in one preview
transaction. Approval is matched by Clerk ID; legacy Personal organizations
without Clerk IDs use their original database ID. Approved identities are
included even when none of their tasks were sampled. Unknown/revoked identities
are denied, while budgets, memberships, and API keys remain preview-owned.
The ordinary sample loader never inserts or overwrites `execution_enabled`.

Production must already have the approval column and reviewed decisions before
this step is enabled. A missing source column fails explicitly. Abundant,
SRE-World, and Abundant CyberMasters are successful-access fixtures: the sync
requires production to approve their exact Clerk IDs and fails atomically if
any approved source identity cannot be accessed in the preview. These fixture
IDs validate operator decisions; they do not grant approval. New organizations
still default to unapproved. Run the same sync against existing preview URLs
to refresh their decisions without rebuilding or redeploying them.

This runs in the existing database job even when seeding is skipped, and logs
elapsed time. It overlaps credential publication; the job awaits both before
deployment. It adds no CI job, image build, browser test, or fleet-wide loop.
Approval changes reach a preview on its next preparation/sync, not immediately
when production is edited. A standalone reset rebuilds from production and then
reapplies the current decisions through the same final step.

Hosted dispatch excludes unapproved organizations. Both Modal and EC2 runners
check approval before each job and every 15 seconds during execution; losing
approval or failing to read it cancels the handler. The reconciler also cancels
queued/running task work for unapproved organizations using the existing remote
worker teardown path, including work launched by older code. The revoke command
runs that cleanup immediately. Remote cancellation failures are surfaced as errors;
15 seconds is a polling interval, not a guarantee of instantaneous provider shutdown.
Self-hosted core runners have no approval policy unless their host supplies one.

In Clerk production, disable **Create first organization automatically** and
**Allow user-created organizations** under organization settings, while leaving
membership required. These dashboard controls reduce unwanted organization
creation; backend approval also protects against existing users' organization
creation permissions. The PR does not itself change live Clerk settings.

## Multi-tenancy

All task/trial/experiment access is org-scoped. Cloud-side schema adds:

- `experiments.org_id`
- `tasks.org_id`, `tasks.created_by_user_id`, `tasks.task_s3_key`
- `trials.org_id`, `trials.trial_s3_key`

The API layer enforces this scope in all list/read/write queries.

## Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Use `backend/.env.example` as the starting point for local backend config.
For the API and worker runtime, the minimum required values are:

- `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL`
- `CLERK_DOMAIN`

Required for Clerk-backed org invites, membership lookups, and GitHub username enrichment:

- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`

Required if you want Clerk webhook ingestion enabled:

- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

S3-compatible storage is **required**. Task bundles and trial artifacts are
uploaded directly from the client to S3 via presigned PUT URLs, and the
backend streams logs/results/files back through the same bucket. Configure
the `ODDISH_S3_*` set — access key, secret key, and (for non-AWS providers)
endpoint are required; bucket defaults to `data` and region to `us-east-1`:

- `ODDISH_S3_BUCKET` (default `data`)
- `ODDISH_S3_REGION` (default `us-east-1`)
- `ODDISH_S3_ACCESS_KEY`
- `ODDISH_S3_SECRET_KEY`
- `ODDISH_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` (for non-AWS S3-compatible providers)

Common optional settings:

- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEX`: origin pattern (for example `^https://oddish-[a-z0-9-]+\.vercel\.app$`) admitted in addition to the list, so per-branch Vercel previews can call the API directly when the dashboard runs with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_DIRECT=1`

- `CLERK_ISSUER`
- `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- `ODDISH_AUTH_IDENTITY_TTL_SECONDS` (default 900): how long a container keeps a verified Clerk user's internal ids cached. Role and email always come from the token, so this only bounds how often a container re-reads the user row; API-key entries stay at 60 s.
- `ODDISH_COST_EXCLUSIONS_CACHE_SECONDS` (default 60, `0` disables): how long a container serves the admin cost-exclusion lists from memory. The container that handles an edit refreshes immediately; others within this window.

- provider keys such as `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `ODDISH_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENTS`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `DAYTONA_API_KEY`
- `ODDISH_OPENAI_PROVIDER=openai` plus `OPENAI_API_KEY` only when intentionally routing OpenAI-family jobs to public OpenAI
- GitHub notifier settings such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `ODDISH_DASHBOARD_URL`
- `SLACK_ALERT_BOT_TOKEN` (scopes `chat:write`, `im:write`, `users:read.email`) for deterministic cost alerts, which DM an experiment's owner: a milestone for each $1,000 spent in the past 24 hours, and any trial over $200 that finished in that window. The same token delivers the other DM-only alerts -- trial failed, QA failed, experiment failed -- and resolves in-channel mentions by account email. The email delivery channel has been removed entirely. `SLACK_EXPENSE_WEBHOOK_URL` carries what is left in-channel: unpriceable-model alerts from the past 24 hours; an escalation when a running or retrying trial's live cost rises above the configured floor, which `<@...>`-mentions its owner plus the always-ping list; and a `<!channel>` alert when a user's rolling seven-day spend, including live running-trial checkpoints, rises more than the configured dollar delta above their workspace's average spender. The two channel escalation thresholds and the ping list are set by an admin on the Costs tab of `/admin` and stored in `slack_alert_settings`; the constants in `slack_alert_settings.py` are the defaults they override, and no setting here is environment-configurable. User daily-overage alerts fire at most once per UTC calendar day. The per-user DM cutoffs (the milestone and completed-trial floor) are separate deploy-time constants in `user_alert_prefs.py` that each person tunes in their own notification settings, not admin-editable here. Notifications are on by default for the production app; previews opt in with `ODDISH_ENABLE_SLACK_EXPENSE_NOTIFICATIONS=true` and can attach a preview-only notification secret via `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSE_SECRET_NAME` / `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSE_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT`.
- `ODDISH_SLACK_UNFURL_*` for a lean, single-workspace Slack app that unfurls Oddish task, experiment, and public-share links. It requires `links:read` and `links:write`, a `link_shared` event subscription pointed at `/webhooks/slack/events`, a signing secret, bot token, and bound Oddish org. Optional team/channel allowlists add defense in depth. This is separate from the expense notifications above.
- `ODDISH_CARL_*`, `ODDISH_API_KEY`, and `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL_RO` extend that same Slack app with read-only answers to permitted `app_mention` events. Carl keeps the existing `/webhooks/slack/events` URL and `link_shared` subscription; add `app_mentions:read` and subscribe the installed app to `app_mention`. The SQL DSN must use a dedicated non-superuser role restricted to the analytics table allow-list. Cloud-bill answers (`catfish_costs`, `catfish_breakdown`) need `CATFISH_API_TOKEN` and optional `CATFISH_API_URL` (defaults to `https://costs.abundant.run`) plus `CATFISH_VERCEL_BYPASS` when Vercel Authentication is on. After changing those keys in `oddish-prod`, recycle only `carl_answer`. Carl's code lives in `carl.py`, `carl_agent.py`, `carl_tools.py`, and `carl_catfish.py`.

### Where provider keys actually live

Provider keys are environment variables **inside the `oddish-prod` Modal
secret** (`main` environment), not standalone secrets of their own. The one
exception is Google Vertex AI: `VERTEX_AI_PROJECT_ID`, `VERTEX_AI_LOCATION`,
`VERTEX_AI_CREDENTIALS_JSON`, and `VERTEX_AI_API_KEY` live in the dedicated
`oddish-vertex` secret, mounted by default (`ODDISH_VERTEX_SECRET_NAME`, `""`
to skip), so the Vertex account rotates on its own.
`RUNTIME_SECRET_NAME = "oddish-prod"` in `backend/modal_runtime.py` is what the
API containers and workers mount, so that is the only place a rotation takes
effect.

Rotate one from the Modal dashboard:

    Apps -> Secrets -> oddish-prod -> Edit -> <VAR>

or from the CLI, only with the complete key set: `modal secret create` has no
per-key update, and `--force` replaces the whole secret with exactly the keys
given, so a single-key call would drop every other credential in `oddish-prod`:

```bash
uv run modal secret create oddish-prod --from-dotenv oddish-prod.env --force
```

A workspace secret whose name merely resembles a variable is not mounted and
editing it changes nothing. `XAI_API_KEYS` exists as a workspace secret, but the
value the workers read is the `XAI_API_KEYS` **variable inside `oddish-prod`**.
The authoritative list of mounted secrets is every `Secret.from_name(...)` in
`backend/modal_app.py` and `backend/modal_runtime.py`; at time of writing that
is `oddish-prod`, `oddish-logfire`, `<app>-db`, and the purpose-specific
Sauron/GKE/Numinous/EC2/Slack secrets. Nothing else reaches a container.

**`XAI_API_KEYS` overrides `XAI_API_KEY`.** `_pick_api_key()` in
`oddish/workers/agents/grok_build.py` reads `XAI_API_KEYS` first as a
comma-separated pool and picks one at random, falling back to `XAI_API_KEY`
only when that pool is empty. Rotating `XAI_API_KEY` while a stale
`XAI_API_KEYS` pool is still set silently keeps the old keys in use. Clear or
update both.

### Cycling workers after a secret change

Modal injects secrets at container start, so running containers keep the old
value until they are replaced. Stop them and let the app start fresh ones:

    Apps -> oddish -> api_app -> Containers -> stop the containers

In-flight requests on a stopped container fail, so cycle when the queue is
quiet, or stop them a few at a time.

### Observability (Pydantic Logfire)

Tracing explicitly accepts incoming W3C parent context. New queued jobs save
only the trace headers and restore that parent for each worker attempt. Retries
and provider reroutes retain the saved parent; handlers do not receive the
reserved trace field. API and worker code must both include this support.

Optional. Provision a write token in Logfire, then create the dedicated
`oddish-logfire` secret in Modal's `main` environment so the API containers and
workers both pick it up without modifying the `oddish-prod` secret:

- `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` — Logfire write token (the only required value).
- `LOGFIRE_ENVIRONMENT` *(optional)* — overrides the auto-detected
  label (`production` / `preview` / `development`). PR previews on
  Modal are auto-tagged `preview` and ride with `oddish.pr=<number>`
  as a span attribute, so you can filter `deployment.environment ==
  "preview"` across all PRs and drill into one with `oddish.pr`.
- `LOGFIRE_SERVICE_NAME` *(optional)* — defaults to `oddish-backend`.
- `ODDISH_LOGFIRE_INSTRUMENT_SQLA` *(optional, default `0`)* — set to
  `1` to also wrap SQLAlchemy executes with span instrumentation. We
  already wrap asyncpg one layer down, and the SQLA wrapper walks
  every statement's expression tree, which is meaningful overhead on
  hot paths.

`ODDISH_MODAL_API_REGION` defaults to `us-east` to place database-heavy API
containers near the hosted PostgreSQL database. Set it in the deploying process
before `modal deploy` when using a database in another region; a runtime secret
does not set deployment placement. This applies only to `api_app`, not workers
or the QA-model gateway. Modal's regional placement pricing applies.

Modal runtime knobs are read directly by `modal_app.py`, which is the source
of truth for the full list and defaults. They cover worker enablement
(`ODDISH_ENABLE_MODAL_WORKERS`, `ODDISH_ENABLE_SLACK_EXPENSE_NOTIFICATIONS`),
API/worker/dispatcher/reconciler container
scaling and CPU/memory sizing (`ODDISH_MODAL_API_*`, `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_*`,
`ODDISH_MODAL_DISPATCHER_*`, `ODDISH_MODAL_RECONCILER_*`), schedule intervals
and timeouts (`ODDISH_MODAL_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
`ODDISH_MODAL_CLEANUP_*_SECONDS`, `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`),
throughput (`ODDISH_MODAL_MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL`, default `256`;
`ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_MAX_CONTAINERS`, default `2688`), per-model concurrency
(`ODDISH_DEFAULT_MODEL_CONCURRENCY`, `ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES`,
`ODDISH_MODAL_NOP_ORACLE_CONCURRENCY`), and app naming (`MODAL_APP_NAME`,
`MODAL_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT`). Numinous registration uses
`ODDISH_NUMINOUS_ENABLED`; `ODDISH_NUMINOUS_GPU_ENABLED` separately advertises
its GPU lane. When enabled, the Modal deployment attaches the secret named by
`ODDISH_NUMINOUS_SECRET_NAME` (default `oddish-numinous`), which must contain
`NUMINOUS_API_URL` and `NUMINOUS_API_KEY`.

Local `backend/.env` values are layered on top of the shared Modal secret for local deploys.

### Ephemeral EC2 Harbor backend

EC2 is an explicit CPU-only provider; Daytona remains the default. Set the
non-secret `ODDISH_EC2_*` launch coordinates from `backend/.env.example` and
name two dedicated Modal secrets:

- The control secret contains `ODDISH_EC2_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
  `ODDISH_EC2_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and optional
  `ODDISH_EC2_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`.
- The worker-only SSH secret contains `ODDISH_EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`.

Only dedicated `ec2_trial` worker functions receive both secrets. Generic trial
workers receive neither; the reconciler and dedicated `teardown_ec2_sandbox`
function receive only control credentials. API and dispatcher functions receive
neither. API cancellation delegates one teardown call to that dedicated
function. EC2 workers materialize the AWS credentials and SSH key as mode-`0600`
temporary files, pass only the named AWS profile and key path to Harbor, and
remove the raw secret variables from the Harbor child. Set
`ODDISH_EC2_MAX_CONCURRENT_INSTANCES` to the provider-wide instance cap; this is
enforced across every model and Harbor variant. The dispatcher subtracts live
EC2 leases before spending its per-poll spawn budget, and workers retain the
atomic lease-acquisition check before claiming a trial.
The control policy must include `sts:GetCallerIdentity` in addition to the EC2
launch, describe, image lookup, tag, and terminate actions listed in
`.env.example`.

Standalone hosts installed with `oddish[worker]` must also provide the OpenSSH
client (`openssh-client` on Debian/Ubuntu), because Harbor invokes `ssh` to reach
the VM. The shared `backend/Dockerfile` already installs this package for the
Railway/Docker deployment path, and the Modal worker image installs it as well.

### Thunder Harbor backend

Thunder is the default GPU provider on deployments that enable it: it sits
between Daytona and Modal in the runtime registry, so a GPU submission with no
explicit environment routes to Thunder when its `gpu_types` names exactly one
accelerator Thunder offers (A6000, A100, H100), while plain-CPU work stays on
Daytona and private-registry pulls, untyped GPU requests, and other GPU types
stay on Modal. Deployments that leave it disabled
keep Modal as the GPU default. A trial that has failed
`ODDISH_THUNDER_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS` attempts on Thunder (default 2; 0
disables) has its next retry moved to `ODDISH_THUNDER_FALLBACK_PROVIDER`
(default `modal`) by the same atomic handoff the capacity fallback uses. Set
these non-secret deploy values in `backend/.env` or the deploy environment:

```bash
ODDISH_THUNDER_ENABLED=true
ODDISH_THUNDER_SECRET_NAME=oddish-thunder
ODDISH_THUNDER_MAX_CAPACITY=128
ODDISH_THUNDER_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS=2
```

Create `oddish-thunder` in the same Modal environment as the app with exactly
`TNR_API_URL` and `TNR_API_TOKEN`. Only dedicated `thunder_trial` workers and
the dedicated teardown function receive this secret. API, dispatcher,
reconciler, generic workers, and EC2 workers do not. For example:

```bash
uv run modal secret create oddish-thunder \
  TNR_API_URL="$TNR_API_URL" \
  TNR_API_TOKEN="$TNR_API_TOKEN"
```

The global capacity is enforced with durable, atomic provider leases across
all organizations, models, queue keys, and Harbor variants. Cancellation and
orphan cleanup operate on the persisted sandbox ID through the provider SDK.
Thunder uses `thunder-sandbox==0.7.3` and its Python dependencies (`aiohttp`,
`asyncssh`, and `cryptography`); it does not shell out to `ssh`, `scp`, or
`ssh-keygen`.

Sync the locked deployment environment, deploy, and validate the remote worker
without printing credentials (commands run from `backend/`):

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run modal deploy deploy.py
uv run modal run thunder_readiness.py::check_thunder_worker
```

Then, from the Oddish repository root, submit the hermetic smoke task with one
deterministic `nop` attempt:

```bash
oddish run ../smoke_test_thunder/task --env thunder -a nop \
  --n-trials 1 --max-trial-attempts 1 --json
```

Keep the returned task/trial IDs. `oddish status <task-id> --json` must show the
agent trial in `environment: thunder` with reward `1`; pulled artifacts must
contain the expected GPU output. Separately cancel an in-flight smoke trial and
confirm its persisted sandbox ID is terminated. Finally, verify the Thunder
provider inventory contains none of the sandbox IDs created by either run and
that the `sandbox_capacity_leases` count returns to its pre-smoke value.

### oddish runtime patching

`endpoints.py`, `serve.py`, and `worker/runtime.py` patch oddish settings at startup:

- `endpoints.py` / `serve.py`: set `db_use_null_pool = False` and configure a small real pool (size 2, overflow 1) for the API; NullPool is the *workers'* setting (`worker/functions.py`)
- `worker/runtime.py`: refresh DB connections per container, ensure the per-container Harbor scratch dir exists (defaults to `/tmp/harbor-jobs`), and materialize GCP application-default credentials when configured

## API Endpoints

All routes require auth unless marked public.

## Database and Migrations

Two migration stacks are required on fresh environments:
1. Core tables: `oddish/alembic/`
2. Cloud tables/extensions: `backend/alembic/`

```bash
# Core (run in oddish/)
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Cloud (run in backend/)
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Apply migrations against the database in `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL` (for example a hosted Postgres instance).

## Development Workflows

```bash
# Install backend deps (includes the local ../oddish path dependency)
cd backend
uv sync
```

```bash
# Backend only (Modal local serve)
cd backend
uv run modal serve deploy.py
```

For full-stack local development, run the Modal backend and point the frontend at it:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
cd backend
uv run modal serve deploy.py

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `frontend/.env.local` to the `modal serve` URL
(printed by Terminal 1, e.g. `https://<workspace>--api-dev.modal.run`). See
`frontend/env.example` for the full frontend env surface, and
[`../SELF_HOSTING.md`](../SELF_HOSTING.md) for the HTTPS / production-Clerk
variant of this loop.

### Smoke tests

```bash
# authenticated list
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ODDISH_API_KEY" "$ODDISH_API_URL/tasks" | jq

# dashboard queue overview
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ODDISH_API_KEY" "$ODDISH_API_URL/dashboard" | jq '.queues'
```

## User quotas — enforcement rollout (`ODDISH_QUOTA_MODE`)

Per-user dollar budgets use a rolling 24-hour window. Spend counts until 24h
after the trial finished. Caps count trial inference spend only unless
`ODDISH_QUOTA_COUNTS_ANALYSIS_AND_COMPUTE=1`, which additionally folds
analyzer/QA (`analysis_costs`) and sandbox compute (`modal_costs`) into both
windows; it is off by default because turning it on lowers every payer's
headroom at once. The operator toggle is `ODDISH_QUOTA_MODE` (`enforce` by
default; `shadow` observes without blocking). Each stage is a config flip, no
redeploy of code (`off` stays available as a full no-op opt-out):

1. **`shadow`** — compute the check and emit a structured
   `quota.would_block` event (`metric=quota.would_block reason=… org_id=…
   billed_user_id=… used=… limit=…`) but never raise. Scrape those logs to
   enumerate who *would* be blocked and which submissions have an unresolved
   payer (`billed_user_id` None — an unlinked GitHub author); notify those users
   to link at oddish.app. `billed_user_id` is stamped at trial creation, so the
   usage data accrues before any enforcement.
2. **`enforce`** (default) — over-budget submissions get HTTP **402** with
   `{"detail": {message, used_usd, reserved_usd, limit_usd}}`; an
   unattributable run gets **403**.

When an unattributable run is *retried* rather than submitted fresh (`POST
/trials/{id}/retry`), it cannot 403 — there is no payer to bill and refusing
would strand the run. That spend instead pools per org, logged as
`metric=quota.admitted reason=unattributed_admitted`. Set
`ODDISH_UNATTRIBUTED_POOL_LIMIT_USD` to cap that pool over the rolling 24h
(unset = uncapped). Cap it deliberately: the pool drains only by aging, since a
retry copies the NULL payer and re-enters it, and **no per-user override can
raise it** — the fix for a full pool is repairing attribution.

There is **no seed/coverage pre-step**: stamping is already live from the
attribution slice, and a member with no `quotas` override row is enforced at
`ODDISH_DEFAULT_DAILY_QUOTA_USD` (default-at-read). When `quota_mode != off`, the
API startup verifies `trials.billed_user_id` and the `quotas` + `quota_bumps` +
`org_quotas` tables exist. Under `enforce` a missing object **fails startup**,
naming what is absent: `oddish/` and `backend/` migrate on separate alembic
trees, so deploy-before-migrate is a real window, and serving every request
uncapped is worse than being down. Set
`ODDISH_ALLOW_QUOTA_SCHEMA_DEGRADE=1` to opt into the older behaviour (log and
force `off`) instead. Under `shadow` it always degrades rather than failing —
nothing is relying on enforcement. Tune `ODDISH_DEFAULT_DAILY_QUOTA_USD` and
`ODDISH_PENDING_TRIAL_RESERVATION_USD` without a code change.

Oddish pauses live Harbor jobs before the hard cap. The default reserve is 5%
of the effective user or organization quota; set
`ODDISH_QUOTA_PAUSE_REMAINING_PERCENT=0` to disable it. An optional
`ODDISH_QUOTA_PAUSE_REMAINING_USD` reserve can be used instead or alongside it;
when both are set, the larger reserve wins. The soft check counts settled spend
plus cost already reported by running trials, while the existing hard cap
remains the cancellation backstop. A paused trial's `trials.status` becomes
`PAUSED`, while its owning `worker_jobs` row stays `RUNNING`; it keeps its queue
slot and heartbeat, and resumes after rolling spend expires or its quota is
raised.

**Temporary quota bumps.** `POST /quotas/{user_id}/bumps` grants `+amount_usd`
for `duration_hours`, with expiry computed on the DB clock (immune to client
clock skew); `DELETE /quotas/{user_id}/bumps` revokes a member's live
bumps by stamping `revoked_at` (audit rows survive). Effective limit is
`base + SUM(live bumps)` where live means `revoked_at IS NULL`, `deleted_at IS
NULL`, and `expires_at > NOW()` (read-time expiry on the DB clock — no scheduler
or revert job). After a bump expires the member's spend still counts in the
rolling window, so they may block at the base limit — that is intended.

### Org-wide monthly cap

Layered on top of the per-user rolling window is an **org-wide aggregate
CALENDAR-MONTH (UTC) cap**: the sum of *all* payers' settled spend in an org
(including unattributed NULL-billed spend) plus its in-flight reservation. It
resets on the 1st (UTC) to match billing periods. It ships **inert** —
`ODDISH_DEFAULT_ORG_MONTHLY_QUOTA_USD` is unset (`None` = no org cap) and no
`org_quotas` override rows exist, so the org check short-circuits until a cap is
configured. Enable per-org via `PUT /quotas/org` (admin, `require_can_manage_quotas`)
or globally via the env default. Under `enforce`, an over-cap submission gets
HTTP **402** (`"Your organization is over its monthly budget …"`); under
`shadow` it emits `metric=quota.would_block reason=org_over_budget`. Admins see
month-to-date org usage on `GET /quotas`; any member can read the org budget
snapshot + adaptive daily goal on `GET /quotas/org`. Admission takes no
locks; concurrent submissions can briefly overshoot a cap and the
enforcement sweep cancels the overage. Only the sweep takes the quota
advisory locks (org → payer, non-blocking).

### Model endpoint monitoring

The operator Admin overview shows failing or overdue model connections. Healthy
connections stay behind **All connections and history**. Opening the page reads
saved observations; **Check again** schedules one check and does not start a trial.
Checks only establish whether a small completion works. They do not test agent
startup, tools, long contexts, or capacity under load.

Apply backend migration `endpoint_health_001` before deploying. The scheduled
functions register by default in production (`MODAL_APP_NAME=oddish`), and are
off in staging and PR previews. To exercise them in a non-production app, set
`ODDISH_ENABLE_ENDPOINT_MONITORING=true` in the deployment environment. Set the
same flag to `false` when deploying to disable the schedules. The API reports
that disabled state explicitly.

Set `ODDISH_ENDPOINT_MONITORS` in the app's runtime secret to a JSON array of
connections to check. An empty array means no connections are monitored; the
UI does not report that as healthy. Reference the same provider credentials and
endpoint settings used for execution. Do not paste secret values into the array.
For example (replace the deployment/model names with those actually configured):

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Primary OpenAI deployment",
    "model": "azure/your-deployment-name",
    "api_key_env": "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "api_base_env": "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT",
    "api_version_env": "AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"
  },
  {
    "name": "Direct Anthropic",
    "model": "anthropic/your-model-id",
    "api_key_env": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
  }
]
```

Model strings use LiteLLM's explicit provider/model form. Optional `api_base_env`
and `api_version_env` reference runtime variables; endpoints must be HTTPS with
no embedded credentials or query string. Bedrock entries use `bedrock/<model-id>`,
a required `region`, and the app's standard AWS runtime credentials, without
`api_key_env`. `max_tokens` defaults to 1,024 and accepts 32–4,096: reasoning models
may need budget before emitting visible text. Requests have a 20-second SDK
timeout and a 22-second outer deadline, with SDK retries and response caching
disabled. No router or provider fallback participates in a check.

Connection identity includes the model and configuration references, but not the
display name. Changing a reference creates a new history; rotating the secret
behind the same reference continues that connection's history. Removed entries
are disabled on the next scheduler run. History links remain readable for 30 days.
This first version monitors explicit platform connections, not customer-owned
keys or models discovered by scanning trial history.

The scheduler wakes every minute, claims up to 10 due connections, and sends at
most five concurrent requests without holding database connections. Normal checks
are due every 15 minutes. Failures and monitor errors are due again after one
minute, subject to the batch limit. Two consecutive provider failures open one
incident; a successful completion closes it. Monitor defects are shown separately
and never establish or resolve a provider incident. A missing observation for
30 minutes is overdue even if the last result succeeded. At the maximum supported
100 connections, first checks and large simultaneous failures can take multiple
scheduler ticks to drain; the one-minute confirmation is a due time, not a latency
promise.

A check batch uses four SQL statements: synchronize configured connections, claim
work, update current state, and insert check history. An incident transition adds
one bulk Slack-outbox insert in the same transaction. An idle tick uses two
statements. Claims expire after three minutes and are fenced by unique tokens, so
late or duplicate results cannot overwrite a newer claim. The hourly retention
job deletes at most 20,000 observations older than 30 days per run.

Alerts use the existing Slack channel sender. Configure `SLACK_EXPENSE_WEBHOOK_URL`
and enable `ODDISH_ENABLE_SLACK_EXPENSE_NOTIFICATIONS` for that deployment; the
optional named Slack secret is shared with the monitor. Each incident creates at
most one opening and one recovery outbox record. Delivery runs on the existing
five-minute schedule, adding up to a delivery interval in the normal case. Slack
failures leave records pending. Delivery is at least once: a process crash after
Slack accepts a message but before the database acknowledgement can duplicate it.
The card reports when channel alerts were unavailable at the last check.

Only administrators in `ODDISH_OPERATOR_ORG_ID` may read status/history or request
checks. Notifications link to `/admin?endpoint=<connection-id>`. Provider exception
text, completion text, and secret values are not persisted. History stores
sanitized failure descriptions, HTTP status, latency, and a provider request ID
when available. The current-status request and a bounded history request each use
one monitoring query, in addition to the existing authentication queries.

For local database verification, point `ENDPOINT_TEST_DATABASE_URL` at a disposable
PostgreSQL database and run `pytest tests/test_endpoint_health.py` from `backend`.
That suite recreates the monitoring tables and its isolated Slack-outbox fixture;
it must not target an application database. Provider calls are mocked.

### Trial artifact isolation

`ODDISH_TRIAL_ARTIFACT_NAMESPACE` adds a deployment namespace to new trial
artifact paths. Use a distinct value (letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens)
for each database sharing an S3 bucket. Modal deployments set it automatically
to the secret environment plus app name. Existing stored artifact pointers
remain readable; changing this value during an unfinished import is unsupported.
The default empty value preserves the self-hosted storage layout.
