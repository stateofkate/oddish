# Register the oddish-owned mapped classes so the session-level filter in
# ``soft_delete.py`` auto-applies ``deleted_at IS NULL`` to their reads.
# ``TaskVersionModel`` and ``WorkerJobModel`` inherit ``deleted_at`` via
# ``TimestampedMixin`` but are intentionally *not* soft-deletable:
#
# * ``TaskVersionModel`` rows are immutable history of a task; deletion
#   is exclusively via the parent task's CASCADE.
# * ``WorkerJobModel`` rows model scheduling state; the queue uses
#   ``status = 'CANCELLED'`` to retire jobs (see ``delete_*_core``),
#   not ``deleted_at``.
#
# Backend-only auth models (organizations / users) register
# themselves from ``backend/models.py`` so this module stays standalone.
# ``APIKeyModel`` lives in this module, but its soft-delete registration
# still happens from ``backend/models.py`` (alongside the other auth models).
