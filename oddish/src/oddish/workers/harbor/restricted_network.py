"""Fail-closed runtime capabilities for restricted agent phases.

The network-policy orchestrator must not guess from a submitted agent or model
name.  It resolves the *effective* class that Harbor will instantiate and asks
that class for one complete capability: model transport plus the settings that
disable server-side web tools.  Custom agents can participate by implementing
``restricted_network_profile`` with the structural signature documented by
``RestrictedNetworkProfileProvider`` below.

The compatibility adapters in this module cover Oddish's current stock
operational agents while the same hook is adopted upstream.  They are keyed by
the exact resolved Python class, never by inheritance, trial-facing aliases, or
model-name branches in the runner.  An unrecognised class is rejected before
``Job.create`` whenever the task requests a restricted agent phase; public
tasks do not consult this module.
