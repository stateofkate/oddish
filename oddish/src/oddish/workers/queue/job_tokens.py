"""Job-scoped credential bundles (design spec §5.4 / §6.6).

A claimed trial can be issued a short-lived, **least-privilege** credential
bundle instead of the worker reading the blanket ``oddish-prod`` secret:

* the **model API key(s) for this job's provider only** — a Claude job's bundle
  carries the Anthropic key, never the OpenAI/Gemini keys — injected into the
  agent env in place of the blanket key set;
* an **S3 write prefix** that scopes oddish's *own* trial-artifact uploads to
  this trial's prefix — an oddish-side check in ``StorageClient`` (defense in
  depth against a path-traversal escape on that upload path). It does **not**
  cover Harbor's or other tools' uploads (they use their own credentials); full
  cross-path write isolation would need IAM/STS-scoped S3 credentials (§14.2);
* a random **token** whose SHA-256 hash is persisted on the ``worker_jobs`` row
  (the raw token is never stored) as the revocable credential handle, revoked on
  terminal status.

This module is pure (no DB / network). The gated wiring lives in the trial
handler (issue the bundle, inject the scoped model env, revoke on terminal) and
``StorageClient`` (enforce the prefix on oddish's trial uploads), behind
``settings.job_scoped_tokens_enabled`` (default off; dual-read hedge: bundle if
present, else the blanket secret).
