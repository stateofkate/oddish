# Oddish CLI

> Run Harbor tasks on Oddish infrastructure.

`oddish` is a Python CLI for submitting Harbor tasks, running multi-trial sweeps,
monitoring experiments, and pulling logs and artifacts back to disk. If you
already use `harbor run`, Oddish adds persistent state, retries, queueing, and
better operational tooling around the same task format.

Python `3.13` is required.

## Quick Start

```bash
uv pip install oddish

export ODDISH_API_KEY="ok_..."

# Submit a run
oddish run -d swebench@1.0 -a codex -m openai/gpt-5.2 --n-trials 3

# Explicitly use an operator-enabled ephemeral EC2 backend
# oddish run ./my-task --env ec2 -a codex -m openai/gpt-5.2

# GPU tasks default to Thunder on a Thunder-enabled deployment; --env thunder
# selects it explicitly, --env modal opts a GPU task back onto Modal
# oddish run ./my-task --env thunder -a nop --n-trials 1 --max-trial-attempts 1

# Append trials to a task an experiment already runs; add
# --use-default-version to target the task's default version instead
# oddish run --task <task_id> -E <experiment> -a codex --n-trials 2

# List and watch progress
oddish ls
oddish status
oddish status <task_id> --watch

# Pull logs and artifacts locally
oddish pull <task_id> --watch
```

Omitted reasoning effort uses the agent’s own default.
Use `--agent-kwarg reasoning_effort=high` (or another supported value) to set it explicitly.

The CLI targets Oddish Cloud by default. All API-backed commands require
`ODDISH_API_KEY`. For self-deployed instances, also set `ODDISH_API_URL`.

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install oddish
```

Common environment variables:

```bash
export ODDISH_API_KEY="ok_..."

# Point at a self-deployed instance instead of Oddish Cloud
# export ODDISH_API_URL="https://<workspace>--api.modal.run"

# Optional dashboard override
# export ODDISH_DASHBOARD_URL="https://www.oddish.app"
```

Controllers may pass W3C headers in `ODDISH_TRACE_CONTEXT` JSON to link CLI API
calls to a parent trace. See [`../DOCS.md`](../DOCS.md). Storage requests do not
receive this context.

## Commands

- `oddish qa export --ids-file task-ids.txt --output qa-findings.csv` — export existing `must_fix` findings and a companion task-summary CSV; accepts positional task IDs and `--all-versions`.

Run `oddish --help` or see [`../DOCS.md`](../DOCS.md) for the full CLI
reference. The main commands are:

- `oddish run` — submit local tasks, registry datasets, sweeps, retries, and
  task-level QA retries. Hosted environments are `modal`, `daytona`, `ec2`,
  `gke`, `archil`, `thunder`, and `numinous`; Archil, EC2, and Numinous are controlled by
  deployment settings. When Numinous is enabled it is the first CPU candidate;
  otherwise Daytona is the hosted CPU default. GPU tasks are placed by the
  deployment: Thunder when it enables it, otherwise Modal, and Modal whenever
  the run needs a private-registry pull. Numinous GPU registration has a
  separate deployment flag.
- `oddish upload` — register task bundles or import off-oddish Harbor trial results; `--overwrite-current-version` corrects the selected version in place.
- `oddish preflight` — check task name, internet/reward declarations, optional GPU types, and task integrity before `run` or `upload` (pass `--force` there to submit anyway).
- `oddish ls` / `oddish status` — browse tasks (including lab history, QA, author, model, and trajectory-metric filters; `--filter-options`, `--count`, and `--ids` for selection) and inspect progress. `oddish status <trial_id>` shows single-trial detail; `--detail`/`--versions` show a task's version history and cost rollups; `--queue` shows queue & worker scheduler diagnostics.
- `oddish logs` — stream a running trial's live transcript and cost estimate (`--follow` to poll until it ends); finished trials are served by `oddish pull` instead.
- `oddish costs` — billable-spend accounting (org-wide, or per-user with `--user`).
- `oddish admin concurrency` — inspect, set, or clear operator queue-key concurrency overrides with verified readback.
- `oddish cost-exclusions` — hide spend for models and experiments that were never really paid for.
- `oddish cancel` — cancel active runs or task-level QA.
- `oddish pull` — download logs, results, trajectories, and artifacts; `--debug-files` lists a trial's raw S3 inventory instead.
- `oddish combine` — merge finished trials from multiple experiments.
- `oddish collect` / `oddish experiment create` — build read-only trial collections; `collect` can auto-publish a share link.
- `oddish link` — print the dashboard URL for a task or trial (built locally; needs no API key).
- `oddish delete` — delete trials against hosted Oddish (admin key); whole-task/experiment deletes are refused for Modal-hosted APIs, and a standalone core server has no delete endpoints at all.
- `oddish publish` / `oddish unpublish` — toggle public read-only experiment sharing.
- `oddish backfill-analysis` and `oddish probe` — specialized QA/probe tools.
- `oddish delivery` — create and manage delivery checklists; `customers` / `create-customer` manage destinations, and `create` / `add --tasks-file` accept a complete `oddish ls --ids --json` selection. `oddish ls --delivery-history` shows recorded shipments. `oddish ls --share-selection NAME` saves matching task IDs for the organization; `--selection-id ID` reopens them.
- `oddish assign` — assign QA review ownership by task IDs or `--tasks-file`; active delivery boards show the owner.
- `oddish skill` — print the packaged SKILL.md or install the complete agent skill with its reference files.
- `oddish version` — print the installed CLI version (`--check` compares with the latest PyPI release). No API key.
- `oddish update` — upgrade a `uv pip install oddish` install from PyPI. No API key.

Most commands support `--json` for machine-readable output; `oddish logs`,
`oddish link`, `oddish skill`, and the `oddish probe` helpers do not.

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Submit a run
oddish run -d swebench@1.0 -a claude-code -m anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5

# 2. Inspect or watch it later
oddish status <task_id> --watch

# 3. Pull outputs when you want them locally
oddish pull <task_id> --watch
```

[PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0](LICENSE) allows personal and other noncommercial
use, plus use by the organizations listed in the license. Commercial use outside
those terms requires a separate license from the rights holders. Contact

Delivery sign-off requires a fix or individual acknowledgment for every reported
task defect, including historical lower-severity findings. The CLI sends the
reviewed version; new versions require a new decision. See `../DOCS.md`.

### Homebrew installation

The private Homebrew tap requires GitHub read access to `abundant-ai/homebrew-tap`.
Install `gh` with `brew install gh`, then run `gh auth login` and
`gh auth setup-git`. Install with `brew install abundant-ai/tap/oddish`.
Set `ODDISH_API_KEY` for your Oddish organization before making API requests.
Update with `brew update && brew upgrade abundant-ai/tap/oddish`. Homebrew owns
this installation; `oddish update` directs you to Homebrew instead of replacing
it from PyPI. `oddish version --check` prints the Homebrew check command.
The Homebrew package includes CLI and shared client helpers, not the Oddish
server, database, or worker implementations. Releases are maintained in
https://github.com/abundant-ai/homebrew-tap.
