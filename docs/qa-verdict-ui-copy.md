# QA verdict UI wording changes

This change standardizes task-level review/result wording as QA verdict. It does not change QA execution, verdict rules, eligibility, request targets, costs, stored field names, filtering, or human sign-off. Error explanations and the distinctions between absent, failed, queued, running, stale, and accepted/rejected verdicts remain visible.

QA cost stays QA cost. Pre-trial audit, findings, trajectory summaries, trial classifications, mixed QA history, QA work ownership, and human actions such as “Review evidence” retain their separate meanings. Cancellation stays “Cancel QA” because it can stop audits as well as task QA. The analysis used to produce the verdict is labeled Run QA Verdict; the recorded GOOD/BAD/HARNESS outcomes retain their meanings. The run-analysis legend keeps its separate meaning; its shared error label is made explicit so changing verdict labels cannot call a solver harness error a failed task verdict.

## Complete before-and-after list

All changed user-visible labels, headings, tooltips, accessible action names, notification preference descriptions, and fallback messages are listed below. Repeated replacements are grouped. `[count]`, `[version]`, and `[for vN]` stand for existing interpolated values; their values and selection logic are unchanged. Fixture names and internal identifiers are not UI vocabulary and are not renamed.

## Validation

- Existing verdict, delivery, and task-action tests exercise state mapping, accepted/rejected results, missing/outdated states, and unchanged action guards. The failure presentation check also confirms its original diagnostic text is retained.
- Frontend TypeScript checking and ESLint on changed TypeScript files pass.
- The three Python files have identical syntax trees after replacing string contents with a placeholder. Their calculations, conditions, state writes, and calls are unchanged.
- Direct calls to delivery QA presentation cover version mismatch, queued, running, failed with retained evidence error, and missing completion time.
- The local fixture UI shows the new task-verdict labels and retains the original failure explanation. It uses fixture data, not live QA executions.
- Twelve targeted browser tests passed: six delivery scenarios and six QA scenarios. They retain checks for request counts, selected versions, history refresh, requirement links, failure explanations, finding links, filtered rows, and Back/reload pressed-state persistence.

## Reverted on 2026-09-16: per-trial analysis surfaces

The rows below were reverted after the rename was found to have swept
per-trial classification surfaces (one trial's Good/Bad success/failure
state) into verdict wording. The task-level verdict wording above is
unchanged. Vocabulary: Pre-trial audit (static checks before trials),
Trial analysis (per-trial classification), QA verdict (combined result),
QA (the whole pipeline).

| Agree/Disagree with the [classification] verdict (screen-reader name on one trial's report) | Agree/Disagree with the [classification] analysis | `components/qa-report/qa-assessment-report.tsx` |

Unchanged on purpose: the experiment KPI tile counts tasks by verdict
state, so its "QA verdict in progress" / "QA verdict failed" / "No current
QA verdict" chips keep verdict wording. The trials-table legend counts
trials by classification state and reads "Analyzing".

## 2026-09-18: four verdict words

Task-level verdict labels now use one of four leading phrases. "Verdict
accepted" and "Verdict rejected" are the two results. "Verdict pending:"
is followed by what is still missing before a verdict can exist (queued,
generating, not yet generated, regeneration needed, needs agent trials).
"Verdict failed" is reserved for a verdict generation run that did not
complete; its detail is the run's error text.

The change that motivated this: a task that settles with no QA-eligible
agent trials is stored as a failed verdict whose error begins with
"Insufficient evidence" (`oddish/core/verdict_state.py`,
`INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE_ERROR`). It used to read "QA verdict failed", which
looks like an infrastructure failure. The server (`is_insufficient_evidence`)
and the dashboard (`lib/review.ts`, `isInsufficientEvidence`) both recognize
that prefix and label it "Verdict pending: needs agent trials".

| No current QA verdict was generated (status `error`) | No current QA verdict was generated; regenerate the QA verdict (status `outdated`) | `core/delivery_qa.py` |

The delivery QA status `error` is now produced only when the latest QA run
did not succeed. A QA run that succeeded without publishing a verdict the
task still owns is `outdated`, since regenerating the verdict resolves it.
A task whose current verdict error is the insufficient-evidence text reports
`never` with that error as detail, even when an older failed QA run exists for
the version: the task settled after that run without QA-eligible trials. The
experiments list counts such tasks under `verdict_pending`, not
`verdict_failed`, so its "Failures" and "Verdict pending" filters match the
experiment page.
`lib/review.ts` gained two review states: `no_evidence` (failed verdict with
the insufficient-evidence error) and `missing` (verdict job succeeded, no
verdict recorded); both filter as unreviewed.
