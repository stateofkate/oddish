# Self-Deploying Oddish

This guide walks through deploying and developing your own Oddish stack.

The recommended architecture:

- **Backend API + workers** on [Modal](https://modal.com) (serverless)
- **Postgres** that you control (Neon, Supabase, RDS, etc.)
- **S3-compatible bucket** for task bundles and trial artifacts
- **Frontend dashboard** on Vercel/Docker for API key management and run inspection
- **Clerk** for dashboard auth and org/user management

There are two workflows covered below:

- [Local Development](#local-development) — iterate against an ephemeral Modal backend with the frontend on HTTPS so Clerk production keys work
- [Production Deployment](#production-deployment) — deploy the backend to Modal and the frontend to Vercel / a container host

Both workflows share the same prerequisites, environment configuration, and
migration steps. Read [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) and
[Configure environment](#configure-environment) once, run the migrations, then
jump to whichever workflow you need.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python `3.13` and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js `20+` and `pnpm`
- [Modal](https://modal.com) account + CLI (`modal`)
- A Postgres connection string
- An S3-compatible bucket + access key pair
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com) application (for dashboard auth)

Install and authenticate the Modal CLI:

```bash
uv pip install modal
modal setup
```

---

## Configure environment

For a traced controller that invokes the CLI, optional `ODDISH_TRACE_CONTEXT`
JSON carries W3C `traceparent` and `tracestate` to API requests. With tracing
configured on both API and workers, new queue rows retain that parent through
worker attempts. Existing rows need no migration. Invalid context is ignored,
and storage requests do not receive it.

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Minimum required values:

```bash
ODDISH_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:5432/db

# Clerk JWT verification + webhook ingestion
CLERK_DOMAIN=clerk.your-domain.com
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# S3-compatible storage (required)
ODDISH_S3_BUCKET=...
ODDISH_S3_REGION=...
ODDISH_S3_ACCESS_KEY=...
ODDISH_S3_SECRET_KEY=...
ODDISH_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=...
```

Provider keys (add the ones you plan to use). OpenAI-family jobs default to
Azure OpenAI:

```bash
# Use an OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as *.openai.azure.com/openai/v1 or
# *.services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1. Do not use the Foundry project endpoint
# ending in /api/projects/<project>.
ODDISH_OPENAI_PROVIDER=azure
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR-RESOURCE.openai.azure.com/openai/v1
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=...
ODDISH_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENTS='{"openai/gpt-5.2":"azure-gpt-5-2","gpt-5.2":"azure-gpt-5-2"}'
GEMINI_API_KEY=...

# To use public OpenAI instead, explicitly set:
# ODDISH_OPENAI_PROVIDER=openai
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Claude Code uses direct Anthropic when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is present because
# ODDISH_CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_DIRECT_API defaults to 1. Set that flag to 0 to use
# the Modal image's Bedrock route instead.
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...

# Bedrock credentials are required when direct routing is disabled.
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=...

# Google Vertex AI (--model vertex_ai/<model>, Gemini and Claude alike): a
# service account with roles/aiplatform.user, dedicated to Oddish and rotated
# (its key file is readable inside the trial sandbox, like every provider key).
# Enabling a Claude model in Model Garden needs the Consumer Procurement
# Entitlement Manager role on the person clicking. VERTEX_AI_LOCATION defaults
# to "global". VERTEX_AI_API_KEY (an express-mode key; Vertex rejects ordinary
# Cloud API keys) is optional and published alongside the JSON. Hosted Modal
# deploys read these values from the dedicated oddish-vertex secret
# (ODDISH_VERTEX_SECRET_NAME, "" to keep them in the runtime secret).
VERTEX_AI_PROJECT_ID=...
VERTEX_AI_CREDENTIALS_JSON='{"type":"service_account",...}'
# VERTEX_AI_LOCATION=global
# VERTEX_AI_API_KEY=...
```

See `backend/.env.example` for the full list of optional knobs (CORS, GitHub
integration, Modal scaling, etc.).

### Frontend (`frontend/.env.local`)

```bash
cd frontend
cp env.example .env.local
```

Minimum required values:

```bash
# Clerk (test keys for localhost; prod keys for the local HTTPS flow)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=oddish

# Backend URL (see the workflow sections below)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

For the local HTTPS flow with Clerk production keys, also set:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://local.oddish.app
```

---

## Run database migrations

Two migration stacks must be applied against the same database — core (from
`oddish/`) and cloud (from `backend/`):

```bash
# Core tables
cd oddish
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Cloud auth / extensions
cd ../backend
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Re-run these whenever you pull changes that touch either `alembic/` directory.

---

## Configure Clerk

### JWT template

In Clerk, create a JWT template named `oddish` (matches
`CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE` in the frontend env) with claims:

```json
{
  "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}",
  "org_id": "{{org.id}}",
  "org_role": "{{org.role}}"
}
```

### Webhook

Point a Clerk webhook at your deployed backend:

```text
https://<your-modal-workspace>--api.modal.run/webhooks/clerk
```

Copy the signing secret into `backend/.env` as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

---

## Local Development

This workflow runs the backend on an ephemeral Modal deployment and the
frontend locally on HTTPS so you can use Clerk production keys during
development.

### 1. Start the backend (`modal serve`)

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run modal serve deploy.py
```

`modal serve` hot-reloads on code changes and prints a URL like
`https://<workspace>--api-dev.modal.run`. Keep this terminal open.

### 2. Prepare the local HTTPS host

The frontend needs to run on an `oddish.app` subdomain with trusted TLS so
Clerk's production keys accept the origin. `frontend/run-prod-clerk-local.sh`
handles cert generation (via `mkcert`) and launches Next.js on port 443.

One-time setup:

```bash
# 1. Add the subdomain to /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 local.oddish.app" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# 2. Install mkcert and the local CA
# macOS: brew install mkcert
# Linux: use your distro package manager, or see https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
mkcert -install
```

### 3. Configure `frontend/.env.local` for local HTTPS

Point the frontend at the Modal dev URL from step 1 and use Clerk **production**
keys (so JWTs are accepted by Clerk across the `oddish.app` origin):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<workspace>--api-dev.modal.run
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://local.oddish.app

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=oddish
```

### 4. Start the frontend on HTTPS

The dev server listens on port 443 and caches its build in `.next/`. Because
port 443 requires elevated privileges, the script re-execs itself under `sudo`
— which means any subsequent `pnpm dev` on the same `.next/` directory will
hit permission errors. Blow away `.next/` before each HTTPS run:

```bash
cd frontend
sudo rm -rf .next && ./run-prod-clerk-local.sh
```

Then open <https://local.oddish.app>.

> If you instead want a plain `http://localhost:3000` dev loop with Clerk
> **test** keys, skip the HTTPS flow and run `pnpm dev`. That's usually
> simpler when you don't need production Clerk behavior.

### 5. (Optional) Seed an API key for CLI testing

```bash
export ODDISH_API_URL="https://<workspace>--api-dev.modal.run"
export ODDISH_API_KEY="ok_..."   # created from the dashboard Settings page
oddish status
```

---

## Production Deployment

### 1. Deploy the backend to Modal

Provision your Modal secret (named `oddish-prod` by default, override with
`RUNTIME_SECRET_NAME` in `modal_app.py`) with the same values you put in
`backend/.env`. Then:

```bash
cd backend
uv run modal deploy deploy.py
```

That publishes the stable API + workers:

```text
https://<workspace>--api.modal.run
```

Wire up the Clerk webhook (see [Configure Clerk](#configure-clerk)) against
this URL and re-run migrations if needed.

### 2. Deploy the frontend

Deploy to Vercel. Set these env vars in the hosting platform:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<workspace>--api.modal.run
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=oddish
```

### 3. Use the stack

```bash
export ODDISH_API_URL="https://<workspace>--api.modal.run"
export ODDISH_API_KEY="ok_..."   # created from the dashboard Settings page

oddish run -d terminalbench@2.0 -a codex -m openai/gpt-5.4-mini --n-trials 3
```

Per-model concurrency can be tuned via backend env vars:

```bash
ODDISH_DEFAULT_MODEL_CONCURRENCY=64
ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES='{"openai/gpt-5.2": 64, "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5": 32}'
```

### Trial artifact isolation

`ODDISH_TRIAL_ARTIFACT_NAMESPACE` adds a deployment namespace to new trial
artifact paths. Use a distinct value (letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens)
for each database sharing an S3 bucket. Modal deployments set it automatically
to the secret environment plus app name. Existing stored artifact pointers
remain readable; changing this value during an unfinished import is unsupported.
The default empty value preserves the self-hosted storage layout.
