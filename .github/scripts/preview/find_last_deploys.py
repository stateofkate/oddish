"""Decide, per preview component, whether it needs redeploying on this push.

Everything here is driven by the GitHub API (no local git history required, so
it works with the default shallow checkout). It emits the change signals that
compute_deployment_plan.sh turns into the deploy plan:

1. Whole-PR flags (pr_backend / pr_migrations / pr_frontend): does the PR, as a
   whole, touch each component (diffed against the PR base branch). Used on the
   opened/reopened events and as the fallback when a component has no recorded
   deploy yet. Replaces the old `filter_pr` dorny step.

2. Last-successful-deploy bases (backend_base / migrations_base) and incremental
   flags (backend_changed / migrations_changed / workflow_changed): on a
   *synchronize* push, find the most recent run on this branch whose component
   step succeeded, even if another job later failed, and diff only the new push
   against it (and the previous push, for workflow/scripts). A later successful
   teardown invalidates older deploy bases. This is what lets a frontend-only
   follow-up push skip the ~15-min preview DB seed without mistaking a stopped
   preview for a live one.

We compute all of this ourselves rather than using dorny/paths-filter because
that action (a) *ignores* its `base` input on pull_request events -- it always
diffs the whole PR -- and (b) under its default `predicate-quantifier: some`,
a filter containing negated excludes (e.g. `!backend/alembic/**`) matches almost
any path, so the backend filter reported "changed" for unrelated changes. Both
bugs forced the preview DB seed + backend redeploy when they shouldn't have.

Fail-safe philosophy: if the API call fails, or a diff is too large to trust,
default to "changed" -- mild over-deploy is strictly better than blocking CI or
shipping a stale preview. If a component has no deploy base yet, its incremental
flag is left empty and compute_deployment_plan.sh falls back to the whole-PR flag.

Inputs (env vars):
  OWNER_REPO     - e.g. "abundant-ai/oddish"
  EVENT_ACTION   - github.event.action (opened/reopened/synchronize)
  HEAD_REF       - PR head branch name (no refs/heads/ prefix)
  HEAD_SHA       - PR head sha (github.event.pull_request.head.sha)
  PR_BASE_SHA    - PR base branch sha (github.event.pull_request.base.sha)
  BEFORE_SHA     - previous push sha (github.event.before)
  GH_TOKEN       - read access for the `gh` CLI
  GITHUB_OUTPUT  - file the action runner reads outputs from
